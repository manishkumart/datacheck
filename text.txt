In his book, "To Heal a Fractured World," Rabbi Jonathan Sacks emphasizes the importance of fulfilling our obligation to care for others. He challenges us to address issues such as hunger, poverty, and curable diseases, reminding us that there is still work to be done. Rabbi Sacks also highlights the need to promote harmony among nations and combat hatred among individuals.

At Yeshiva University, Rabbi Sacks has been a source of inspiration for the creation of two unique groups of graduate scholars: the Sacks Research Scholars and the Sacks Impact Scholars. These programs were established in response to the success of the previous year's Sacks Scholars Graduate Fellowship, demonstrating the ongoing commitment to Rabbi Sacks' teachings and values.
The Sacks Research Scholars fellowship is designed to empower graduate students from Azrieli, GPATS, Revel, and RIETS by enhancing their professional skills and expanding their leadership abilities. Through studying, researching, publishing, and teaching the teachings of Rabbi Sacks, participants engage with contemporary Jewish ideas. In his book Future Tense, the author emphasizes the importance of a new generation of Jews engaging in a dialogue between religious and secular issues to effectively apply Torah principles in the modern world. The focus is on gaining a deeper understanding of the world to enable Judaism to address its challenges successfully.
We are excited to introduce the distinguished members of the Sacks Research Scholars for the 2023-2024 academic year. Among this year's cohort is Rabbi Tzvi Benoff, a third-year fellow at the Wexner Kollel Elyon/Kollel L Horaah. Rabbi Benoff also serves as the Assistant Rabbi at the Riverdale Jewish Center and holds a Master's degree in International Political Economy and Development from Fordham University.
Tamar Yastrab Koslowe is currently in her second year of studies at GPATS and is also participating in Nishmat's prestigious Yoatzot Halacha Fellows Program. Prior to this, she obtained a Bachelor of Science degree in computer science from Stern College and gained valuable experience working on a risk management team at JP Morgan.
Neti Linzer Penstein is currently a second-year student in GPATS, where she is working towards her MA in Jewish Philosophy at the Bernard Revel Graduate School. Prior to this, she obtained a BA in philosophy from Princeton University and gained experience as a teaching fellow at both Maayanot and Maimonides high schools.
Asher Willner is a dedicated third-year student at RIETS, where he also serves as a Rabbinic Intern at the Young Israel of the West Side. Prior to pursuing his rabbinic studies, he obtained a BS in computer science from Columbia University, where he shared his passion for learning by teaching a weekly Talmud class.
Alisa Zeffren is currently pursuing her doctorate at the Azrieli Graduate School of Jewish Education and Administration. In addition to her studies, she serves as a Jewish studies teacher and Student Activities Director at Ida Crown Jewish Academy in Chicago.
The cohort will gather every other month to collaborate on their research, writing, and teaching endeavors, as well as participate in leadership training sessions alongside the esteemed Sacks Impact Scholars fellowship. This diverse and interdisciplinary group includes graduate students from various schools within Yeshiva University, all dedicated to making a positive impact in their respective fields.
Following Rabbi Sacks' inspirational message, Yeshiva University is dedicated to creating positive change and healing the divisions in our world. We are proud to welcome scholars like Megan Priaulx (Cardozo) who will be actively involved in the Perlmutter Center for Legal Justice. Megan will be conducting legal research, investigating cases, and advocating for social justice on behalf of those who have been wrongfully convicted.
Shira Levy (Ferkauf) will collaborate with high school students seeking asylum to provide mental health support in a group setting, allowing them to openly discuss and heal from the traumas they have endured during their journeys to seek asylum. 

Ann Squicciarini (Fish) will develop interfaith Holocaust education programs, materials, and lesson plans to educate communities with limited exposure to Jewish history and culture about the events that led to the rise of Nazi Germany and the atrocities committed during the Holocaust. This initiative aims to raise awareness about the antisemitic beliefs and sentiments that fueled the persecution of Jewish people during this dark period in history.
Thota Manish Kumar (Katz) will utilize artificial intelligence to create a model that enhances online courses by recognizing course content, answering questions, and engaging with students to improve their learning experience.

Michelle Borde and Eitan Kastner (Syms) are working on a software platform that connects higher education institutions with adjunct instructors. Additionally, they are strengthening YU's partnership with the IRS VITA program to provide tax assistance to low-income residents in the community.
The group of scholars from various backgrounds will engage in monthly leadership training sessions together and work on individual projects to make a positive impact in their schools. Dr. Shira Weiss, Assistant Director of the Sacks-Herenstein Center, and Dr. Erica Brown, the Center's Director, will provide guidance and support to all scholars in both cohorts.
In response to the growing demand for accessible mental health services in Israel, Yeshiva University and Amudim Israel are collaborating to launch the Jerusalem Therapy Center in September 2022. This center will cater to English speakers, gap-year students, and Israelis, offering essential mental health counseling services that have become increasingly crucial due to the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic and other factors, such as prolonged lockdowns and associated stressors.
The Center, a collaboration between the Wurzweiler School of Social Work and Amudim Israel, will provide crucial mental health services to English-speaking immigrants in Israel. Staffed by Wurzweiler graduate students, recent graduates, and specialized professionals, the Center will offer support to individuals and families impacted by trauma, addiction, and other complex mental health issues. It aims to address the diverse needs of immigrants, including those struggling with the psychological effects of the pandemic, gap-year students navigating independence for the first time, and new immigrants adjusting to life in Israel.
Dr. Selma Botman, provost and vice president for academic affairs, highlighted Wurzweiler's distinctive role in not only training future mental health professionals, but also in delivering essential services to the community in Israel. This opportunity aligns with the University's broader mission of meeting the needs of individuals in Israel. As a respected institution, YU takes pride in offering exceptional training, support, and expertise to the people of Israel.
The Center's main focus is on gap-year students who arrive in Israel to study for a year after graduating from high school. These students are typically experiencing independence from their families and usual support systems for the first time. Unfortunately, they are often not covered for mental health counseling under their temporary health insurance. The Center aims to offer essential, affordable, and high-quality mental health care to support this vulnerable group.
Navigating mental health issues can be a daunting task for many in Israel's English-speaking community. From diagnosis to treatment, the process can be overwhelming and confusing. Finding English-speaking practitioners adds an extra layer of complexity, while understanding and accessing mental health services within the health system can be a challenge.
In response to the difficulties experienced by English-speaking individuals in Israel, Wurzweiler collaborated in hosting a Mental Health Expo in Jerusalem in May. The event successfully attracted over 1,500 participants, highlighting the need for improved mental health services. This strong community support served as a driving force in the establishment of the Jerusalem Therapy Center.
Nechama Munk, senior program director of Wurzweiler in Israel, emphasized the urgent need for mental health services in our community. As part of our commitment to helping those in need, the Therapy Center aims to provide support and hope to those struggling with mental health issues. Accessing quality and affordable treatment can be difficult for all Israelis, especially for those whose mother tongue is not Hebrew.
In light of the current circumstances, it is clear that the importance of mental health services has never been more crucial. Recent studies have revealed a 25% rise in cases of anxiety and depression since the pandemic began, serving as a stark reminder for nations worldwide to prioritize and enhance mental health services and resources.
Munk explains that COVID-19 has not caused new mental health problems, but has magnified preexisting challenges. In his article for Future Tense, he emphasizes the importance of understanding the world in order to apply Torah teachings effectively. He calls for a new generation of Jews who are dedicated to bridging the gap between sacred and secular beliefs, in order for Judaism to effectively address the issues of the world.
The Center will cater to marginalized groups, including soldiers dealing with PTSD and immigrants facing financial, cultural, and psychological stress. Additionally, the Jerusalem Therapy Center will offer training and enrichment seminars for gap-year professionals to enhance their skills in supporting students facing challenges.
During a presentation at the esteemed International Congress of Industrial and Applied Mathematics in Tokyo, Dr. Marian Gidea, the associate dean for STEM research and director of graduate mathematics at the Katz School, shared findings from a simplified mathematical model. This model illustrated that oscillating steel beams constructed from piezoelectric materials generate greater energy output when their movement follows a consistent pattern.
The study titled "Energy Growth, Dissipation, and Control in Hamiltonian Systems" is funded by a $300,000 grant from the National Science Foundation. This research, awarded in July, aims to explore dynamical systems and their applications in energy harvesting, celestial mechanics, and space mission design. The term "piezoelectric" originates from the Greek root "piezo," meaning pressure or push, and refers to the unique ability of certain solid materials to convert energy from applied pressure into an electrical charge.
The computer model was a collaborative effort between Tamar Leiser, who conducted her honors thesis on the subject while studying at YU's Stern School for Women, Samuel Akingbade, a Mathematics Ph.D. student at Katz School, and research partners from Georgia Tech and Polytechnic University of Catalunya.

The researchers developed a framework where two steel beams are connected to a capacitor and suspended above magnets. When the vibration of the beams exceeds the mechanical friction, electricity is generated and stored in the capacitor.
Dr. Gidea revealed that the results we obtained were expected, as the beams that exhibit regular, periodic motion accumulate more energy than those moving chaotically.
Energy harvesting devices utilize external vibrations to generate electrical charges and can be installed on skyscrapers, trains, or bridges, offering a sustainable and limitless source of renewable energy. Piezoelectric energy harvesting is particularly well-suited for wearable devices, as it is highly efficient at generating power on a smaller scale.
The steel beams in the Katz School model were coated with ceramic, a cost-effective material known for its efficient piezoelectric properties, making it ideal for energy harvesting. By utilizing piezoelectricity, the need for frequent charging of devices and batteries can be significantly reduced or eliminated altogether. This in turn would alleviate the burden on consumers to constantly be near electrical outlets, leading to a more sustainable use of electricity.
Dr. Gidea believes that the ability to implant these devices in pacemakers to stimulate the heart could be a significant breakthrough in healthcare.

Established in 1976 and located in New York City, the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law is named after Supreme Court Justice Benjamin N. Cardozo. The school graduated its inaugural class in 1979.

Various clinics offer legal services to individuals, as well as handle class action lawsuits. Some of these clinics include the Civil Rights Clinic, Bet Tzedek (which focuses on representing elderly and disabled individuals), the Filmmakers Legal Clinic, the Immigration Justice Clinic, the Innocence Project, the Human Rights and Atrocity Prevention Clinic, and the Tech Startup Clinic, among others. One of the most well-known clinics is the Innocence Project, led by Professor Barry Scheck, which has successfully used DNA profiling to exonerate numerous innocent individuals and played a crucial role in several prominent cases.
Cardozo boasts a distinguished faculty with seven members who have clerked for U.S. Supreme Court Justices, and has produced two graduates who have been selected to clerk for the U.S. Supreme Court: Sara J. Klein '05 (for Justice John Paul Stevens) and Cliff Elgarten '79 (for Justice William J. Brennan, Jr.). In 1999, Cardozo was inducted into the prestigious Order of the Coif, recognizing its excellence in legal scholarship.

Furthermore, Cardozo made history by being the second U.S. law school to participate in The European Law Moot Court Competition, and the first American law school to receive consecutive invitations. With a network of over 12,000 alumni, many of whom are based in the New York metropolitan area, Cardozo graduates have also made their mark internationally and throughout the United States.
In 2022, U.S. News ranked Cardozo Law School 52nd out of 196 law schools nationwide, making it the 5th highest-ranked law school in New York State. Additionally, in 2012, Cardozo's LL.M./Master of Laws program was recognized as the tenth best by the American Universities Admission Program.

Cardozo Law School has excelled in specific areas of law, with high rankings in Dispute Resolution (4th) and Intellectual Property Law (8th) according to the 2023 US News rankings. The school's Music Law program has also been recognized in the top ten in the country.

Furthermore, Cardozo received A-grades in various categories by National Jurist's preLaw Magazine in 2018, including Tax Law, International Law, Alternative Dispute Resolution, and Business Law. The magazine also ranked Cardozo highly in Government and Public Defender/Prosecutor specializations, placing it 11th in the nation.
In 2022, the passage rate for first-time test takers at the New York bar exam was 83.5%, slightly higher than the state pass rate of 82.7%. Among the 349 graduates from 2020, 95.6% of those who took the bar exam within two years passed. The LL.M. program at the law school allows entry in either the Spring or Fall Term for J.D. students interested in New York bar courses.
While the majority of Cardozo students start their legal studies in August, there are some who begin in May. These May-entry students complete their first-year courses over three semesters - summer, fall, and spring - and then join fall-entry students for their first-year classes in the following fall and spring semesters.

For those who already hold a law degree, Cardozo provides LL.M. programs in General Studies, Comparative Legal Thought, Dispute Resolution and Advocacy, and Intellectual Property. LL.M. students have the flexibility to choose from a wide range of courses to tailor their studies to their interests and career goals.
Cardozo's ABA-required disclosures show that a high percentage of their graduates secure meaningful employment within ten months of graduating. The Class of 2021 had 81% of graduates obtain full-time, long-term, bar passage-required jobs, while the Class of 2018 had 87% secure full-time, long-term JD-required or JD-advantage positions. Additionally, the law school is ranked 25th in the country for Gold Standard jobs, which are full-time, long-term positions that require bar passage and are not funded by the school. Cardozo also ranks 37th in the percentage of graduates hired by the 100 largest firms.
The total cost of tuition and fees for the 2021-2022 academic year at Cardozo was $68,462. According to Law School Transparency, the estimated total cost of attendance for three years, including living expenses and not accounting for any discounts, is $323,858.
Cardozo's urban campus is situated in the heart of Greenwich Village, at the intersection of Fifth Avenue and 12th Street. Housed in the 19-story Brookdale Center, the campus underwent a multimillion-dollar capital improvement project in 2006. This renovation not only expanded the physical space of the Brookdale Center, but also led to the creation of a state-of-the-art library, modern offices and clinic spaces, and a more spacious lobby, moot court room, and ground-floor seminar room.
Furthermore, renovations were made to older classrooms to modernize the facilities. In the autumn of 2006, the Greenberg Center for Student Life was inaugurated as a tribute to former Dean David Rudenstine. This new addition to Cardozo featured a student lounge and a café on the third floor. Additionally, new seminar rooms, internal stairways connecting floors, and extra windows were also added to enhance the overall environment of the campus.
The Innocence Project relocated to a new office space, enabling them to expand their team and take on more cases. The Fogelman Library and the Cooper Union library serve as additional resources for Cardozo students when the main library is closed on weekends and holidays.

President Ari Berman of Yeshiva University has announced the launch of "Rise Up: The Campaign for Yeshiva University," a comprehensive campaign aimed at funding scholarships, facilities, and faculty programs to ensure the continued success of the University. The campaign, which launched in December, aims to raise millions of dollars over the next five years to support student success in a rapidly changing world.
The Rise Up Campaign for Yeshiva University has successfully raised over a million dollars during its initial quiet phase, with investments focused on four strategic areas: values and leadership, science and technology, entrepreneurship and innovation, and creating meaningful careers.
Under Berman's leadership, fundraising for the University has increased significantly from approximately $1 million annually in the past to $5 million in the present. The Torah provides guidance on honoring God, showing respect for others, and fostering an ethical society.

Raising $5 million for scholarships, faculty, and facilities reflects our commitment to these core Torah values and ensures our future needs are met. With a dedication to academic excellence and preparing our students to be tomorrow's leaders, the flagship Jewish university is experiencing growth. Berman encourages others to join in supporting the future of the university.

The early commitments made during the campaign's initial phase demonstrate strong confidence in Yeshiva University's future and have already had a positive impact through various new initiatives.
The Azrieli Graduate School of Jewish Education and Administration offers scholarships for aspiring Jewish educators, focusing on values and leadership development. Additionally, the Emil A and Jenny Fish Center for Holocaust and Genocide Studies provides training for educators at all levels, as well as graduate programs in the field.
The Rabbi Lord Jonathan Sacks Center for Values and Leadership, established by Terri and Andrew Herenstein, is committed to promoting core Torah values and educating future leaders through the teachings and life lessons of Rabbi Sacks. In addition, the center has introduced new undergraduate scholarships such as the President Leadership Scholars program, aimed at nurturing the next generation of Jewish communal leaders.
Exciting Opportunities for Meaningful Careers: The creation of the Shevet Glaubach Center for Career Strategy and Professional Development is a reflection of our commitment to providing top-notch resources for student success.

Additionally, students have the opportunity to tap into YU's extensive alumni network of real estate professionals for guidance and mentorship.

The success of the initial phase of the program can be largely attributed to the exceptional leadership of the Campaign Planning Committee, which is co-chaired by Senator Joseph Lieberman and Anita Zucker.
Anita Zucker expressed gratitude for the generous support from donors during the quiet phase of the campaign. She is optimistic that the public phase will yield equally impressive results, thanks to the dedication and hard work of the Campaign Cabinet members: Elliot Gibber, Billy Greenblatt, Andrew Herenstein, Lance Hirt, Ira Mitzner, Ann Pava, and Mark Wilf.
We are excited to witness the potential that can be achieved when we unite to support the development of the future leaders. Senator Lieberman emphasized the growing importance of leaders who possess a well-rounded education and strong moral principles in today's world.
Yeshiva University offers a distinctive education that aims to fulfill a special mission. The Rise Up campaign will enhance our ability to achieve this mission and expand our impact. The campaign is being launched at a time of significant success, with the University rising in the U.S. News World Report rankings and being recognized in the best value category.
In the past four years, YU has introduced numerous new programs, such as an associate degree in liberal arts, bachelor programs in business analytics, finance, marketing, strategy, and entrepreneurship, as well as master degrees in Holocaust studies, cybersecurity, and physician assistant studies. Additionally, during this time, the University has significantly increased graduate school net tuition.
In addition to launching a doctoral program in occupational therapy, Yeshiva University (YU) has expanded its partnership with Montefiore and the Albert Einstein College of Medicine. This includes the introduction of a new BA/MD program, providing a direct route to the medical field for exceptional high school graduates in YU's honors programs.

Furthermore, the YU Maccabees have achieved the impressive feat of being ranked number one in the nation in Division basketball. They also hold the record for the longest winning streak in men's college basketball, with a remarkable string of consecutive victories.
To kick off the campaign, the University Office of Institutional Advancement has organized a series of events in various cities across North America, such as South Florida, Los Angeles, Houston, the Hamptons, Long Island, New Jersey, Chicago, and Toronto. One of the highlights was a virtual celebration during Yeshiva University's Annual Hanukkah Dinner on December 1st.
The virtual celebration was attended by philanthropic donors, University friends, student leaders, faculty, and staff. The event was hosted by Gayle King, a television personality, editor at large of Oprah Daily, and co-host of CBS Mornings. The celebration also included performances by the renowned opera tenor Andrea Bocelli and other distinguished YU luminaries.
Researchers at the Katz School, led by Honggang Wang, are working on an innovative AI-powered wearable device that can track and detect illicit drug use in individuals struggling with substance use disorder. Wang's research paper introduces RP STREAM, an algorithm that analyzes data from the device to accurately identify instances of drug use.
In order to create their model, the researchers gathered data from individuals who had a history of cocaine use and were equipped with a wearable biosensor known as Affectiva Q. This device is capable of monitoring a range of physiological changes including electrodermal activity, physical activity, and body temperature.

To determine instances of cocaine use, the researchers examined patient records, urine tests, and data collected from the biosensor. While some studies have been effective in identifying drug use patterns, they typically analyze data over extended periods of time. Wang noted that detecting drug use is a complex process that requires careful consideration of various factors.
This innovative new method is able to detect drug use in shorter time intervals, similar to analyzing a movie frame by frame rather than all at once. The team, led by Prof Wang, shared their findings at the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers IEEE International Conference on Connected Health Applications Systems and Engineering Technologies. The team included colleagues Joshua Rumbut and Hua Fang from the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth and University of Massachusetts Chan Medical School, as well as Edward Boyer from Ohio State University and Harvard Medical School.
The RP STREAM algorithm utilizes real-time precision pattern recognition to accurately detect polysubstance use episodes in wearable biosensor data streams. By incorporating rules derived from previous research, the algorithm effectively distinguishes between different substances and identifies substance use episodes with accuracy. Additionally, the algorithm incorporates an intelligent threshold-setting mechanism to differentiate between substance use episodes and other anomalies in the biosensor data.
Wang stated that the current methods for identifying substance use relapses are inadequate, as they often fail to account for varying durations and patterns of use that occur over several days. This limits their effectiveness in real-world situations where substance use behaviors are not consistent.
Medical professionals typically rely on testing urine or blood samples to determine drug use, but these methods may not provide accurate timing information. Additionally, individuals may intentionally deceive or simply forget about their drug use. In a recent study, RP STREAM successfully detected instances of cocaine and cannabis use, with episodes lasting an average of a few minutes.
In a comparison to another method, RP STREAM was found to be more accurate in detecting substance abuse by avoiding false alarms. Wang expressed a desire to further develop this method to enhance its ability to identify substance use in new participants. This research is crucial in gaining insights into the factors that contribute to substance abuse and potentially predicting instances of relapse.
At the Zahava and Moshael Straus Center for Torah and Western Thought, we explore how individuals' tolerance to drugs evolves over time in real-world scenarios. This research allows us to gain insight into patterns of drug use and develop effective strategies to support individuals in overcoming addiction. Additionally, our center hosts annual summer seminars for high school students, exploring the intersection of Jewish and Western texts.
In Manhattan, the programs for women and men brought together more than forty students to participate in interdisciplinary seminars and activities, providing them with a collegiate-level learning experience and the opportunity to engage with the esteemed faculty of the YU Straus Center. The event began with a breakfast and welcoming remarks from Shaina Trapedo, the Straus Resident Scholar and Recruitment Officer.
The session delved into the intriguing dialogue between Founding Fathers Thomas Jefferson and John Adams, focusing on their discussions about the Hebrew Bible and its interpretive tradition. Through their correspondence, students examined how the Founding Fathers' interest in the history, morality, and aesthetics of the Hebrew Bible influenced the framing of the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution.
Throughout the day, a series of seminars delved into diverse themes, texts, and questions that explored the intersection of Torah with various cultural and political aspects of Western thought. This provided a glimpse into the wide range of topics covered in Straus Center courses. In his seminar titled "Torah and Western Thought: The Ethos of the YU Straus Center," Rabbi Meir Soloveichik, the Director of the Straus Center, discussed the significant influence of the Torah on Western civilization, surpassing that of any other text.
, Rabbi Soloveichik passionately highlighted the transformative power of the Torah's worldview in shaping America's future, emphasizing its crucial role as a foundational pillar of the country's origins.
Trapedo's discussion on Psalms and the American Founding encouraged students to consider how current auction prices of literary works, such as the Shakespeare Folio, the Bay Psalm Book, and the Codex Sasson Bible, offer insight into society's perceptions of wisdom and its monetary and moral worth in the 21st century.

The following session, "Torah and Art: Yetziat Mitzrayim and the Birth of Jewish Political Thought," included a visit to the Metropolitan Museum of Art with Rabbi Soloveichik.
During the tour, Rabbi Soloviechik highlighted the significance of often overlooked artifacts and hieroglyphics in the Egyptian collection, shedding light on the political aspects of the Exodus. He discussed how elements such as the Paschal lamb, the ten plagues, and the iconic unleavened bread of the Seder have been central to Jewish life and faith for centuries.

After the tour, Neil Rogachevsky, Straus Center Associate Director and author of "Israel Declaration of Independence: The History and Political Theory of the Nation's Founding Document," led a session on Torah, Zionism, and the Israel Declaration.
He stressed the significance of the Declaration from a political standpoint, noting that without a political entity, the Zionist movement could have come to a standstill. Although the Declaration could have ideally provided a more detailed plan for the future state of Israel, it was ultimately created out of necessity.
In his session on Torah, Literature, Myth, and Monotheism, Rabbi Dov Lerner, Clinical Assistant Professor at the Straus Center, delved into the concept of monotheism and the importance of the consistent emphasis found in Tanakh and daily liturgy on the oneness of God.

Rabbi Lerner highlighted the risks associated with a Dualistic society, where the belief in separate good and bad deities only serves to complicate rather than resolve the age-old theological problem of theodicy.
Believing in one God is crucial for recognizing that, despite the complexities and uncertainties of the world, God is both all-powerful and beyond human understanding. 

In the final sessions of the respective seminars, a panel discussion was held with Straus Scholars Allie Orgen (SCW), Yonatan Kurz (YC), and Reuben Hartman (YC). They shared insights into their favorite aspects of the Straus Scholar program, discussed the diverse classes and seminars they participated in, and talked about the leadership roles, fellowships, and internships they engaged in during their time in the program.
Rabbi Ari Berman, President of Yeshiva University, was a keynote speaker at an important panel event launching the inaugural year of programming at the Abrahamic Family House (AFH) in Abu Dhabi. The discussion, titled "Rethinking Sustainability and Peace Through a Spiritual Lens," took place on the International Day of Peace. This event showcased YU's ongoing dedication to strengthening connections and promoting Jewish values on a global scale.
The panelists at the event were Monica Menendez, Associate Dean of Engineering for Graduate Affairs at NYU Abu Dhabi, and Rabbi David Rosen, Special Advisor for Interfaith and Jewish Affairs to the Abrahamic Family House. Abdulla Al Shehhi, Acting Executive Director of the Abrahamic Family House, also shared his remarks during the event.
President Berman expressed gratitude for the opportunity to discuss important topics such as environmental preservation, the climate crisis, and the role of religion and ethics in addressing these challenges. He emphasized the importance of drawing on the wisdom of the Jewish faith to tackle the universal challenges of the future.
Yeshiva University is honored to be a part of this significant moment in history, as we remain committed to amplifying the Jewish perspective in important global discussions on morality. Since its launch in February, the AFH has successfully reached audiences worldwide, serving as a valuable platform for the dissemination of Jewish values.
The venue serves as a symbol of tolerance and education, bringing together a mosque, a church, and the Ben Maimon Synagogue. President Berman's involvement represents YU's ongoing efforts to foster connections with Jewish, Muslim, and Christian communities on a global scale.
In April, he made history by speaking at the inaugural Holocaust Commemoration event in an Arab country held at the Crossroads of Civilization Museum (CCM) in Dubai. 

In May, YU collaborated with Mohammed Bin Zayed University for Humanities (MBZUH) to host a groundbreaking academic conference in the UAE titled "Interacting Philosophies, Shared Friendships." Faculty members from both universities presented scholarly discussions on the political, philosophical, and social interactions between Judaism and Islam. The event was attended by community members, Emirati, Israeli, and American dignitaries, as well as students.
President Berman was accompanied by a delegation of students and faculty from the YU Straus Center for Torah and Western Thought during the visit. The group had the opportunity to meet with esteemed local leaders, such as H.E. Ahmed Almansoori, the founder of the CCM, Amir Hayek, Israeli Ambassador to the UAE, Israeli Consul General Liron Zaslansky, and Marc Sievers, former Ambassador to the Sultanate of Oman and Director of the AJC Abu Dhabi.
The group engaged in seminars led by Straus Center faculty that delved into the history and laws of Jewish and Islamic cultures. The YU delegation also had the opportunity to connect with academic leaders and students at the MBZUH campus.
The students were given a special VIP tour of the Letters of Light exhibit at the Louvre Abu Dhabi, showcasing ancient sacred texts from the Abrahamic faiths. This experience enriched their understanding of religious history and culture.

To prepare for their roles as future Modern Orthodox leaders, the Straus Scholars are encouraged to pursue summer jobs, internships, and fellowships that complement their studies at the Straus Center. This hands-on experience helps them develop practical skills and knowledge to succeed in their chosen field.
Numerous Scholars dedicated their summer to engaging in programs that focused on studying public policy and philosophy related to their academic and personal passions. We are proud to showcase Scholars who have utilized these opportunities to conduct valuable research and analysis on topics that are significant to the American Jewish community.
Before the recent conflict in Israel, we had the opportunity to speak with Yaakov Willner, a Yeshiva College student who dedicated his summer to intern at various think tanks in Washington DC. Inspired by his studies at the Straus Center, Willner delved into the complexities of foreign policy, criminal justice, and other related topics, eager to deepen his understanding and contribute meaningfully to the discourse.
During his journey, Willner had the opportunity to meet and gain insights from some of the most prominent political and military figures. One important lesson learned was the significant contributions that Observant Jews can make to important discussions on major geopolitical and legal issues.
Please share your experience in the summer programs you attended in Washington D.C., such as the American Enterprise Institute AEI Summer Honors Program and the Hudson Institute Political Studies fellowship.
After completing a year of immersive study in religion, philosophy, and politics at the Straus Center, I felt compelled to further expand my knowledge and experiences by immersing myself in the political landscape of Washington DC. What sparked your interest in these specific programs?
I was drawn to these academic programs due to my passion for foreign policy and national security. I saw them as a valuable stepping stone towards a career in these areas. Knowing that AEI and Hudson are home to some of the leading foreign policy scholars globally, I was eager to seize the opportunity to learn directly from them.
What aspects of each program did you find most appealing? I particularly enjoyed AEI as it provided valuable insights into the Middle East and offered perspectives on how America should navigate its national security interests in the region.
Engaging with American interests does not equate to isolationism or non-interventionism, nor does it entail seeking global domination. It is important to strike a balance in our approach.

This experience was particularly enlightening for me as it shed light on Middle Eastern countries that I had previously overlooked. Understanding their economies, cultures, and geopolitical interests is crucial in safeguarding Israeli security.
On the final day of the AEI program, I was fortunate to listen to Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas. His insights into the intersection of law and national security sparked a deeper contemplation of how these two fields can be effectively combined.
The Hudson program spanned an incredible six weeks, during which I had the opportunity to connect with fellow participants and experts in the field of foreign policy. These individuals are the driving forces behind American foreign policy, and I was able to engage with them, gain insights, and potentially even shape their perspectives through thoughtful questioning.
Did any particular scholars leave a lasting impact on you with their classes? I found value in every course I took and gained knowledge from all of my teachers.
I found my studies in criminal justice with John Walters, President of Hudson, to be particularly engaging. Additionally, learning about the Iranian threat with Michael Doran, Director of the Center for Middle East at Hudson, provided valuable insights. One highlight was the opportunity to participate in policy workshop simulations, such as modeling a National Security Council meeting.
Professionals such as Doran provide valuable insights by highlighting the potential challenges policymakers may face when forming positions on various issues. This experience shed light on the complexities involved in making informed foreign policy decisions.
Navigating through numerous complex elements and conflicting priorities leaves us with limited straightforward options. Additionally, we were privileged to learn from a diverse group of esteemed speakers who provided valuable insights into various aspects of public policy and public engagement on a global scale.
Among the speakers at the event, General Jack Keane and Senator Tom Cotton left a lasting impression on me. General Keane's in-depth analysis of the various threats facing America, particularly from major geopolitical players like Russia and China, highlighted the expertise and knowledge required to navigate the complex issues that the country must address in order to safeguard its citizens and promote freedom globally.
Senator Cotton shared his personal experiences in the military and how they have influenced his character and values, highlighting the selfless sacrifice that service members make for their country. His words were truly inspiring and served as a reminder of the dedication and commitment of those who serve their fellow citizens. I am grateful to the Straus Center for providing me with valuable opportunities for growth and development.
During my time in Washington DC, learning from policy scholars and engaging with my peers, I was reminded of the valuable perspective that Torah Jews can offer to the wider world. It became clear to me how a Torah perspective can truly influence policy making in the political hub of Washington.

Marian Gidea, the associate dean for STEM research and director of graduate mathematics at the Katz School, recently presented groundbreaking research at the esteemed International Congress of Industrial and Applied Mathematics in Tokyo. His study revealed that oscillating steel beams, constructed with piezoelectric materials, generate more energy when their motion is consistent and regular.
The study on Energy Growth, Dissipation, and Control in Hamiltonian Systems is being funded by a three-year grant from the National Science Foundation. This research, which began in July, aims to explore dynamical systems with a focus on energy harvesting, celestial mechanics, and space mission design.

The term "piezoelectric" originates from the Greek root "piezo," meaning pressure or push. It refers to a unique property of certain solid materials that allows them to convert energy from applied pressure into an electrical charge.
The computer model was a collaborative effort between Tamar Leiser, a former student at YU Stern School for Women who wrote her honors thesis on the subject, Ph.D. student Samuel Akingbade from Katz School of Mathematics, and research collaborators from Georgia Tech and Polytechnic University of Catalunya. Together, they developed a framework that involved suspending two steel beams over magnets and connecting them to a capacitor.
Gidea expressed that the electricity generated and stored in the capacitor is a result of the beams vibrating more strongly than mechanical friction. It was surprising to discover that the expected outcome matched the actual result.
Consistent and rhythmic movement of beams generates more energy compared to chaotic movement. Energy harvesting devices that utilize external vibrations can be installed on skyscrapers, trains, or bridges to create a sustainable source of renewable energy. Piezoelectric energy harvesting is especially well-suited for wearable devices as it can efficiently generate power on a small scale.
The steel beams in the Katz School model were coated with ceramic, the ideal material for energy harvesting due to its cost-effectiveness and efficient piezoelectric properties. By harnessing piezoelectricity, the need for frequent charging of devices and batteries can be significantly reduced or eliminated altogether.
This development could greatly benefit consumers by freeing them from the need to constantly be near an electrical outlet, ultimately leading to energy conservation. Additionally, this could have significant implications for healthcare, as these devices have the potential to be implanted in pacemakers to help regulate heart stimulation, according to Gidea.
When a clear drinking glass is filled two-thirds of the way with water and a straw is placed inside the glass at an angle, it may appear as though the straw is broken in two. This optical illusion occurs due to the bending or refraction of light as it crosses the boundary from air to water.
Fredy Zypman, the director of the M A in Physics program at the Katz School, recently published a research paper that delves into the fundamental basis of a simple phenomenon. In his paper "Permittivity from First Principles," published in September by AIP Advances, Zypman explores the relationship between refraction and its atomic origins. He also introduces a mathematical model aimed at providing a deeper understanding of permittivity, a property closely linked to the process of refraction.
Refraction is the phenomenon that occurs when light transitions from one medium to another, causing it to change speed and direction. The index of refraction quantifies this change by comparing the speed of light in a vacuum to its speed in a specific substance.
According to Zypman, the materials in our surroundings, such as plastics, liquids, and the air, possess distinct electrical properties. When an electrical field transitions from one medium to another, light must adapt to the new environment.
This is why we observe shadows and reflections, which are abundant sources of visual experiences in our surroundings. Transparent materials such as glass, water, and diamonds refract light more than air does. This causes the path of light to bend towards an imaginary line perpendicular to the surface of the water when it enters from air.
Bending of light occurs only when it crosses a boundary within a material due to the uniform refractive index. This refractive index is determined by the material's atomic electric response, specifically its polarizability and ability to separate positive and negative charges in response to electric fields, as explained by Zypman.
Polarizability can be understood as the ability of an atom's electrons to shift or become distorted in response to an electric field. This distortion leads to an increase in electric polarization, which in turn affects the material's permittivity. Permittivity is a measure of how much a material resists or opposes an electric field.
Our goal was to establish a clear connection between atomic polarization and the phenomenon of refraction," he explained. The primary objective of the research is to develop precise equations for permittivity at all levels of an electric field, applicable to any intensity of light, and to calculate the permittivity for common materials. After just two weeks into her clinical rotation at St. John Episcopal Hospital in Far Rockaway, Queens, Carin Gannon, a student in the Katz School M in Physician Assistant Studies, faced a challenging situation. A local resident had sustained a deep cut on his leg from a piece of glass and was brought to the emergency department, bleeding heavily.
After undergoing an X-ray to ensure there was no glass remaining in the wound, the patient was returned to the emergency department where Gannon and Abraham Oxilas, a clinical assistant professor at Katz School, were waiting. Gannon, who had not practiced suturing in Oxilas' Clinical Skills and Procedures course for several months, knew that the wound had not yet begun to heal from within after two hours since the injury occurred.
As she observed the yellowish subcutaneous fatty tissue, she took the necessary precautions by washing her hands with soap, donning a pair of sterile gloves, and preparing a suturing kit. Carefully, she irrigated the wound with sterile water and administered seven injections of lidocaine to numb the area before beginning the suturing process.
Oxilas began the sewing process by making the first stitch, then passed the needle to Gannon. With Oxilas supervising closely and Gannon working diligently, the task was completed with care and precision.
to perform the task because of my experience working on a silicone model in class. However, I didn't want to reveal that it was my first time suturing a live patient. Despite my nerves, I knew I had to step up and give it my all.
I had to rely on my muscle memory to guide me. Taking the needle shaped like a crescent moon for suturing, she carefully held the two sides of the wound together as she stitched them up.
Just as intricate as needlework, suturing involves a range of techniques. Gannon utilized the interrupted stitch method, in which each stitch is secured with a surgeon's knot.
She carefully tightened the knots to securely hold the wound closed without causing it to pucker. 

While most simple lacerations can be quickly stitched up in minutes, Gannon spent half an hour carefully sewing seven stitches to close the man's wound.
"It appeared more polished than when I rehearsed it in class," she remarked. "I understand that it may seem like a minor task for PAs to perform every day, but when it's your first time doing it, it can be quite exhilarating to execute those skills."
After receiving care from Gannon, the patient was advised to monitor his wound for any signs of infection, such as redness spreading up or down his leg. Gannon also cautioned the patient against using alcohol or hydrogen peroxide to clean the wound. In addition to a tetanus shot, the patient was prescribed antibiotics and allowed to return home.
"Oxilas praised Carin for her exceptional interpersonal skills, expertise, and ability to quickly adjust to new situations. Her previous experiences in hospitals have enabled her to excel in the emergency room during her first rotation, and I am incredibly proud of her."
Gannon dedicates three hours a week to commuting on the subway from the Bronx to Far Rockaway. During her journey, she immerses herself in the music of her favorite artists Hozier and Noah Kahan. On her return trip, she diligently takes notes on patient diagnoses, tests, procedures, and medications while the information is still fresh in her mind.
Upon completion of her clinical rotation, she will undergo a comprehensive examination in class to assess her understanding of the material. Oxilas praised the Katz School PA program for its dedication to training PAs in cultural competence, enabling them to deliver effective healthcare to underserved communities with diverse needs.
Our students at the Katz School PA program are dedicated to providing comprehensive care for patients, encompassing everything from creating treatment plans and performing procedures to simple tasks like fetching a blanket. Gannon emphasized that the program has taught her to consider all aspects of patient care, including physical, psychological, emotional, and spiritual needs, in order to facilitate recovery.
She is set to graduate in December and eagerly looks forward to her upcoming clinical rotation, where she will gain exposure to different disciplines like endocrinology or pediatrics. She aims to explore various fields before deciding on a career path, but at the moment, her passion lies in emergency care.
Gannon found working in the emergency department and witnessing the impact of PAs to be truly inspiring. He has a deep passion for critical care.
I enjoy engaging with trauma patients in urban areas, and my six years of experience in the emergency department have been invaluable.
Rabbi Kook is often regarded as a significant figure for Israeli religious Zionists, akin to the influence Rabbi Joseph B. Soloveitchik had on modern orthodox American Jews.
The similarities between Rav Kook and the Rav are striking, as both are considered the preeminent thinkers of modern Judaism in the 20th century. They delved into crucial concepts of Jewish nationality, identity, Zionism, and engaged in deep contemplation on how to effectively engage with secularism.
The writings of Rabbi Kook can be complex and challenging to decipher at times. There are instances where his works may appear to be in conflict with each other.
Can you provide an overview of the course's methodology and discuss the literary works studied in class, particularly those written by Rav Kook?
His writing encompasses a mix of essayistic and exegetical styles, with a significant portion taking the form of personal reflections in diary format.
The personal writings found in Rabbi Tzvi Yehuda Kook and Rabbi David Cohen's preserved notebooks and letters offer valuable insights into their lives and teachings.
The writings were intended for a specific audience with a background in mystical training, making them challenging for the general public to understand.
Rav Kook's writings can be challenging to comprehend, requiring readers to carefully analyze the text to understand its message and intended audience. Much of the course involved deep reading and interpretation to uncover the significance of each piece.
During our exploration, we delved into essays penned by Rav Kook that contained some of his most daring ideas, many of which were not published during his lifetime. Our main focus was on Rav Kook's writings about the philosophy of halakha. In Rabbi David Cohen's compilation "Orot HaKodesh," which contains Rav Kook's philosophical writings, we examined his perspective on the nature of knowledge, the world, and ethics.
At Yeshiva University, we prioritize the integration of Torah study and Jewish tradition with secular knowledge. This approach is rooted in the teachings of Rav Kook, who believed that all ideas contain elements of truth. He recognized the strengths and limitations of conflicting religious ideologies, such as those between Hassidic and Misnagdic traditions. This open-minded approach extended to his views on secular Zionism, making his perspective on diverse philosophies a key aspect of his teachings.
Rav Kook embraced the practice of finding merit in the secular Zionists who were often hostile towards religion. He recognized that their rejection of certain aspects of Jewish tradition, formed in the diaspora, was due to a desire to break free from passivity and isolation in the study halls, and engage more actively in the wider society.
Rav Kook gained an appreciation for the positive efforts of those cultivating Israel, despite their rejection of religion, which he believed stemmed from a narrow perspective. He viewed their modern activism as a necessary correction to the passive attitudes of diasporic Jews. In terms of what students should take away from the course, it is important for them to have a deep understanding of Rav Kook himself, rather than just relying on hearsay.
The focus is on developing critical thinking skills. We analyzed the extent to which his arguments were based on assumptions about the people of his time. This helps students gain a deeper understanding of the issues people faced in the 19th century. Lastly, it encourages readers to not be afraid to engage with the material themselves and form their own opinions. On Wednesday, May, Yeshiva University's Zahava and Moshael Straus Center for Torah and Western Thought, Rabbi Arthur Schneier Program for International Affairs, and Bernard Revel Graduate School of Judaic Studies, in collaboration with the Mohamed Bin Zayed University for Humanities, hosted a groundbreaking event that brought together cultures and religious identities at the Crossroads of Civilization Museum in Dubai.
The program, titled "Interacting Philosophies, Shared Friendships," commenced with opening remarks from Ahmed Obaid Al Mansoori, the founder of the museum. He referenced a teaching from the Quran which emphasizes the importance of understanding and connecting with people from various backgrounds. Mansoori highlighted that building relationships with different cultures and religions is a core belief in Islam, and the conference aimed to embody this principle.
Rabbi Stuart Halpern then extended warm greetings on behalf of the Office of the Provost and the Straus Center. He delved into the significance of Sefirat Ha Omer, the Jewish tradition of counting the days from enslavement in Egypt to the Revelation at Sinai. Rabbi Halpern explained that this practice of counting up, rather than down, symbolizes our aspiration towards greater heights while staying connected to our roots.
Tonight, as we come together, we honor the rich history of our Jewish and Islamic communities, looking towards a promising future. After the opening remarks from the deputy mayor of Jerusalem, Fleur Hassan Nahoum, Revel dean Daniel Rynhold commenced the evening with the first lecture of the program.
During the discussion on Maimonides and the Parable of the Sultan Palace, a contextual analysis was provided on how the parable, found at the end of Maimonides' major philosophical work The Guide for the Perplexed, likely mirrors Maimonides' own struggle to balance his medical and communal obligations with his pursuit of divine contemplation.

Following this, Ibrahim Burshashen presented a talk in Arabic on the significant influence that the Islamic philosopher Ibn Rushd had on Maimonides' Guide. Burshashen's colleague Haider Hussain further explored the topic by discussing The Role and Impact of Islamic Civilization on Jewish Philosophy, using Moses Ben Maimon as a key example of the joint interaction between the two cultures.
He emphasized the profound value and humility that comes from studying the dynamic exchanges between Jewish and Islamic cultures, concluding with a heartfelt blessing for Maimonides. 

The final speakers from Yeshiva University were Ronnie Perelis from the Schneier Program and Shira Weiss from the Rabbi Lord Jonathan Sacks Herenstein Center for Values and Leadership.
Perelis discussed the historical interactions between Jewish and Muslim communities in a global society. He highlighted the role of Arabic as a common language that facilitated connections and commerce between people of different faiths in cities like Baghdad and Basra.
Perelis went on to explain how Judeo-Arabic had a profound impact on Jewish engagement with Arabic culture, shaping Jewish literature, grammar, linguistics, and poetry. He expressed hope for further transformations to occur through our interactions, emphasizing the importance of listening to and appreciating others on their own terms, sharing our experiences and challenges, and collaborating to find solutions together.
Weiss provided an insightful analysis of how Ibn Rushd influenced the philosophy of Joseph Albo in his book, "The Influence of Ibn Rushd on the Philosophy of Joseph Albo." By focusing on Albo's work, "The Book of Principles," Weiss highlighted how Ibn Rushd inspired Albo to articulate three fundamental principles: the acknowledgment of God, the truth of prophecy, and the concept of reward and punishment. Weiss also acknowledged the role of divinity as a blessing from God in shaping Albo's philosophical beliefs.
Visiting Abu Dhabi the day after the conference was truly enlightening. Our group had the opportunity to tour the newly constructed synagogue in the Abrahamic Family House, meet with officials at the Ministry of Tolerance, and participate in the historic celebration of Israel Independence Day in the UAE.
Straus Scholars Program has played a vital role in broadening my intellectual horizons and offering me distinctive educational experiences that have influenced my beliefs and empowered me in both my religious and academic journeys. The UAE experience was truly enlightening and I feel honored to have been part of events that will shape a positive future for Muslim-Jewish relations.
Weiss reflected on the YU conference with Mohamed Bin Zayed University as a valuable opportunity for members of both universities and attendees from the Muslim and Jewish communities in Dubai to come together, share ideas, foster connections, and explore potential collaborations.

In addition to the conference, visits to the Ministry of Tolerance and the Abrahamic Family House in Abu Dhabi, which houses a mosque, church, and synagogue, as well as attending the Israeli Embassy's celebration of Israel, provided a fascinating look at the promising future of relationships and partnerships in the UAE.
The generous donation of one million dollars to Yeshiva University will create the Lea and Leon Eisenberg Writing Center at Stern College for Women. This center is a tribute to the memory of Lea and Leon YC Eisenberg, and was established by their children, Larry Eisenberg of Los Angeles, CA, Richard Eisenberg of Lawrence, NY, and Reva Hirsch of Lawrence, NY, who serve as directors of the Eisenberg Family Foundation.
Lea and Leon Eisenberg, residents of Long Beach and Lawrence NY, were dedicated philanthropists who had a strong passion for Jewish continuity, education, and supporting Yeshiva University. Their generous gift is helping to advance Rise Up The Campaign, a comprehensive initiative aimed at providing scholarships, improving facilities, and supporting faculty to ensure the continued success of the University.
Mrs. Eisenberg dedicated many years to serving as the chair of the Stern College for Women Board of Overseers, and remained actively involved both before and after her tenure. Together with Leon Yu, she established the Lea and Leon Eisenberg Beit Midrash at Stern College and generously supported other initiatives at Stern College, Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary (RIETS), and Yeshiva University.
The newly established Lea and Leon Eisenberg Writing Center on Beren Campus will significantly improve the services and offerings of the current writing center. It will be conveniently located next to the Shevet Glaubach Center for Career Strategy and Professional Development. 

In addition to providing students with personalized tutoring in various forms of writing, such as college essays, marketing papers, and lab reports, the center will also offer assistance with crafting cover letters and personal statements for job applications and graduate school.
I was fortunate to work closely with Lea during her time on the Stern College Board of Overseers. Her insightful guidance and the strong partnership she shared with her husband Leon served as a source of inspiration for me, noted Dean Karen Bacon, who holds the position of Mordecai D. Katz and Monique C. Katz Dean of the Undergraduate Faculty of Arts and Sciences at Yeshiva University.
Lea understood the significance of carefully chosen and heartfelt words. This Writing Center will serve as a sincere homage to the legacy of the Eisenberg name.

The text could be rewritten as: "Please provide a more thoughtful and meaningful response."
Making informed decisions about the people involved in a startup, such as cofounders, employees, investors, and board members, is crucial for the long-term success of both the founders and the startup itself. However, these decisions are often made without a clear roadmap outlining the key early decisions, timing, options to consider, and the potential long-term impacts of those decisions.
The primary reason for the high failure rate of high potential startups is due to preventable people problems. Without a clear roadmap in place, founders are more likely to make poor decisions when it comes to managing their team, leading to potential issues such as team conflicts, stunted growth, or even the founder being replaced as CEO.
Having a clear and structured roadmap can greatly enhance the stability and growth potential of founding teams. Founder Bootcamp offers a comprehensive roadmap for both current and aspiring founders to help them navigate their entrepreneurial journey more effectively.
OurCrowd will be hosting an intensive bootcamp for early stage startup founders, aimed at reaching those who can benefit the most from the lessons provided. The bootcamp will include interactive talks, personalized self-assessment exercises, and video appearances by case protagonists to enhance the learning experience.

Abraham Ravid, the seminar coordinator, expressed excitement over this year's virtual seminars, which allowed for the unique opportunity to host two prominent figures in the field. Josh Lerner from Harvard and Nick Bloom from Stanford, renowned economists in innovation and entrepreneurship, collaborated on a joint paper. The Syms faculty had the privilege of offering comments and feedback on an early version of the study, which is expected to have a significant impact in the academic community.
During his visit to the Syms community, Per Stromberg, a former chair and current member of the Nobel committee in economics, shared insights into the process of awarding the prestigious economics prize. Additionally, Renee Adams, a highly respected figure in finance from Oxford University, presented a paper on the impact of personal values on the decision-making of corporate directors globally.
Abraham Ravid, a finance professor and chair of the finance department, and Shu Han, an associate professor of management information systems, both from the Sy Syms School of Business, collaborated on a paper published in Management Science, a prestigious journal that covers various business disciplines. Their research focused on the phenomenon of actor replacements in long-running theater productions.
In contrast to the frequent turnover of top positions in other organizations, the replacement of employees in theater is a controlled experiment. All other variables, such as the play, lines, actors, and physical theater, remain constant. This provides a valuable measure of the economic worth of human talent.

The study reveals that actors who have received prestigious theater awards, rather than movie stars or celebrities, contribute significantly to the success and value of a production.
In their study published in Management Science, Ravid and his colleagues from the University of Texas explored the impact of professional critics in the age of user reviews. Their research in the Journal of Cultural Economics revealed that professional reviewers significantly influence the success of motion pictures, highlighting a lingering skepticism towards reviews from unknown users among consumers.
The study by Ravid and Naciye Sekerci, assistant professors of finance at the University of Utrecht, delves into the comparison of professional and user reviews in today's digital age. Their research, based on Swedish data, reveals that investors with a significant stake in a company are more motivated to enhance the company's value.
This study is not feasible in the United States due to the unavailability of portfolio data. The Journal of Corporate Finance's April issue features an article on the relationship between large investors' portfolios and firm value.
Ravid, an assistant professor of finance at Sy Syms, and Gabriela Coiculescu, along with Yehuda Izhakian, an assistant professor of economics and finance at Baruch College, collaborated on a research paper. This paper, presented by Ravid at the Annual Meeting of the European Finance Association in Helsinki in August and at WEFI, an international entrepreneurship conference in December, explores the significance of ambiguity in investment decisions related to innovation.
After completing his tenure as President of the Midwest Finance Association (MFA), Ravid delivered a presidential address at the MFA annual conference, which was rescheduled from March to August and held virtually. The conference garnered a high number of registrations.
During his presidential address, Ravid delved into his research on human capital within the entertainment and media industries, exploring topics such as the valuation of human capital, discrimination, and technological advancements. The papers he presented were co-authored with Han and Filippo Mezzanotti, an assistant professor of finance at Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management.
Explore our latest blog post which discusses a study from the Journal of Consumer Research revealing that feelings of nostalgia can influence consumer spending habits.
This year, Shu Han and Abraham Ravid successfully published their paper in the renowned journal Management Science, which is highly respected in all areas of business studies.
Before being published, Ravid presented the paper at various conferences and prestigious universities such as Harvard Business School and NYU. The paper explores the phenomenon of actor replacements in long-running theater productions.
Hence, the most accurate indicator of the economic worth of human capital is identified. The research shows that individuals who have received prestigious theater awards are the main contributors to this value, rather than movie stars or celebrities.
In their study published in the prestigious Journal of Cultural Economics, Ravid and his team from the University of Texas explored the significance of professional critics in the age of widespread user reviews, specifically within the context of Broadway shows. Their research revealed that professional critics play a crucial role in the success of motion pictures, indicating that consumers are still wary of reviews from unfamiliar users.

Can you provide some insight into the innovative MS in Taxation Program that is being offered by Sy Syms School of Business? This program exemplifies the forward-thinking approach that Sy Syms is promoting in all areas of business education.
We identified a demand among our students and experienced professionals for advanced technical knowledge and academic qualifications in taxation. In response, we have developed an innovative and affordable Tax Masters program, taught by highly qualified professors with extensive experience. The program is designed to be completed in one year, with small classes held at the Beren YU midtown campus two evenings a week. This schedule allows students to balance work, study for the CPA exam, and earn their MS Tax degree in the evenings, while still having time to enjoy life outside of their studies.
Our tax program covers a range of courses taught by experts in the field, including CPAs, JDs, LLMs, and IRS agents. Subjects include International Tax, Ethical Tax Practice Procedures, State Tax, Contemporary Tax Issues, Estate Tax, Deferred Compensation, and Reorganization Liquidations. Employers are eager to partner with us to recruit our highly educated graduates.
What career did you aspire to have when you were younger? Growing up with a birthday in April, it was clear from early on that I would become a CPA.
Even as a child, I harbored big dreams of becoming a spy for the Mossad, or perhaps even the Chief Rabbi of Israel. However, as I grew older, my aspirations shifted towards becoming a Professor and Director of the Masters in Tax program at YU. Through hard work, dedication, and faith, I was able to achieve my dream.
I maintain connections with students after they graduate by sending them relevant and interesting tax articles via email. However, the most fulfilling way to stay in touch is by running into them at different events or in various countries and catching up on their professional and personal endeavors.
I feel a sense of pride and joy when I hear about someone successfully passing the CPA exam or overcoming a significant technical challenge, and they attribute their success to my support. It always gives me a wonderful feeling, whether it is true or not.
I am a kind and reserved individual who avoids being critical or cynical, which might come as a surprise to others. Let's keep the rest confidential.

What do you enjoy most about working at YU?
I find fulfillment and admiration in working with my students.
Throughout my career, I have had the privilege of teaching at prestigious institutions like Yale and Cornell, as well as state schools like Rutgers. Additionally, I have dedicated a significant amount of time to teaching at Haifa University in Israel. However, I must say that Syms students hold a special place in my heart and consistently impress me with their dedication and academic achievements.
The students exhibit a strong desire for learning, demonstrate respect towards their professors, and consistently put in hard work. The dual curriculum has been instrumental in fostering these qualities, as I have observed with my own children.
In reality, success is best achieved through hard work, which is within our control. I appreciate the opportunity to work closely with colleagues from different disciplines at Syms and YU, as the smaller size allows for more collaboration.
Through my involvement in university committees and leadership positions such as Vice President and future President of the faculty council, I have the opportunity to collaborate with colleagues from diverse disciplines. Additionally, the Jewish calendar has been a benefit as it eliminates the need to reschedule classes for Jewish holidays, which was a common occurrence in my previous teaching experiences at other universities.
Some students pursue careers in finance on Wall Street, typically at banks, while others enter the real estate industry. A significant number of students also choose to further their education by attending graduate schools, with some even enrolling in prestigious institutions such as Penn Law and Wharton. Former students have successfully gained admission to top-tier universities like Harvard Law School and other esteemed institutions.
As a child, what career did you dream of pursuing? I have always been drawn to a wide range of subjects, including math, physics, acting, public speaking, communications, and literature, causing me to frequently change my career aspirations.
As a teenager, I honed my skills in documentary filmmaking before considering studying Physics at Technion. However, my path led me to a career in journalism following my time in the army. While my first job as a journalist was rewarding, I found the daily deadlines limiting. This realization prompted me to pursue a PhD at Cornell University, seeking a more fulfilling and intellectually stimulating career path.
What research project are you currently engaged in? Engaging in research is a key component of a successful career at a prestigious university.
Even after decades in academia, I continue to be enthusiastic about exploring new ideas and delving deeply into various subjects. Recently, colleagues from Cornell and the University of Texas collaborated on a paper that challenges the misconception that internet reviews have superseded professional reviews in influencing consumer movie choices.
A recently accepted paper, co-authored by colleagues from the University of Chicago, NJIT, and the University of Texas, offers fresh insights into firm hedging policies. The study focuses on intellectual property contracts, a topic of great relevance in today's business landscape.
Currently, I am collaborating with my colleague Shu Han at Syms on a project that is funded by the New York City Mayor's Office of Media and Entertainment. This project aims to evaluate the equality of opportunities for women in the film industry, while also exploring the significance of human capital in the theater. Additionally, we are partnering with Gabriela Coiculescu at Syms and a colleague from Baruch on a project that investigates the factors that drive innovation within companies. Lastly, we have ongoing research with a colleague from NYU focusing on the core principles of creating value within businesses.
During my teenage years, I had the opportunity to meet the US Secretary General and participate in various coast to coast TV shows on CBS. This occurred while I was representing Israel at a youth leadership conference organized by the State Department.
Afterward, I attempted to locate recordings of those shows, but CBS did not have them. All I have now are low-quality photos of the TV screen. Despite this, I hold the memories dear and am thankful for the fascinating individuals I encountered during that magical initial trip to the US.
One of the notable delegates at the conference was Erkki Liikanen, who represented Finland. We were roommates during the orientation program for delegates from various countries. Since then, he has gone on to have a successful career, serving as an MP in Finland, then as finance minister, and now as the head of the central bank.
After many decades, we are still connected and in communication.

Shanza Baseer Tariq recently graduated with a master's degree in Biotechnology Management and Entrepreneurship from the Katz School of Science and Health. With a strong publication record, she secured a position as a research assistant at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. In her role at Sloan Kettering, Shanza is involved in conducting basic research on immunotherapy. She works with cell tissue cultures, propagates cell lines, and performs experiments to study the effects of viruses on tumors in mice.
Avi Strauss, a recent graduate of the Katz School's biotech program, conducted a thorough market analysis on a potential new drug therapy for colorectal cancer. The analysis concluded that Sapience Therapeutics, a biotech company based in New York, should focus on developing a novel beta catenin antagonist molecule for the treatment of this cancer. Beta catenin is a crucial component of the Wnt signaling pathway, which not only fuels tumor growth but also hinders the immune system.
Strauss conducted a study on various types of cancer with high mortality rates and resistance to traditional treatments. Along with colorectal cancer, he also examined acute lymphocytic leukemia, breast cancer, melanoma, and multiple myeloma. He discovered that patients with colorectal cancer, in particular, may benefit from Sapience's novel peptide due to a common mutation in the Wnt signaling pathway, which is linked to cancer development.
According to healthcare consultant Strauss of the Marwood Group, colorectal cancer has the highest revenue potential among the five types of cancer studied. Sapience's therapeutic strategy, as explained by Kappel, focuses on targeting protein-protein interactions (PPIs) that are crucial for cancer survival or that hinder the immune system's response to tumors. These interactions, deemed "undruggable," are challenging to treat with traditional small molecule chemotherapies and large biologic drugs like monoclonal antibodies due to their intracellular location.
Kappel explained that peptides possess a unique combination of characteristics from both small and large molecules, offering a promising avenue for targeting intracellular protein-protein interactions and potentially lowering mortality rates in cancer patients and other diseases. Friedman, an adjunct professor in the biotechnology program and advisor to Strauss, praised the presentation for showcasing the Katz School's focus on bridging the gap between scientific knowledge and real-world applications. Avi emphasized the importance of comprehensive understanding of the science, clinical development, and market dynamics in order to effectively bring the project to fruition.

Position yourself for success in the rapidly expanding, lucrative job market by earning a master's degree in biotechnology management and entrepreneurship. A prime example of this is Rebecca Russo Schlossberg, who recently graduated from the program and is currently working on developing an at-home miscarriage test kit for her startup, Genosa Diagnostics.
Many miscarriages that occur at home are often caused by genetic or chromosomal abnormalities in the fetus. These abnormalities, which are present in over half of miscarriages, can lead to developmental issues and ultimately result in an unviable fetus.
The Russo Schlossberg test is crucial for individuals who experience a miscarriage in the first trimester at home, as they often do not have the chance to genetically test the fetal tissue to understand the cause. 

A researcher from Yeshiva University, along with graduate students from the Katz School, will be studying the impact of inhibiting a cluster of small proteins in testicular cells on spermatogenesis, which is the process of sperm production and regulation.
The research being conducted is receiving partial support from a grant provided by the YU Provost Faculty Research Fund, which was awarded to Rana Kahn, the founding director of the Katz School of Science and Health's Master's program in Biotechnology Management and Entrepreneurship.

Upon graduating in May with a master's degree in Biotechnology Management and Entrepreneurship from the Katz School of Science and Health, Shanza Baseer Tariq had already established a publication track record and secured a position as a research assistant at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center.
At Sloan Kettering, Shanza is involved in fundamental research on immunotherapy, focusing on cell tissue cultures, cell line propagation, and conducting experiments to study the impact of viruses on tumors in mice. Meanwhile, Avi Strauss, a recent graduate from the Katz School of Biotechnology, has conducted a thorough market analysis on a new drug therapy for colorectal cancer. The analysis suggests that Sapience Therapeutics, a biotech company based in New York, should explore the development of a novel beta catenin antagonist molecule for the treatment of this cancer.
Beta catenin plays a crucial role in the Wnt signaling pathway, contributing to the growth of tumors and inhibiting the immune system. In his review, Strauss highlighted the challenges posed by several types of cancer with high mortality rates and resistance to traditional treatments, including acute lymphocytic leukemia, breast cancer, melanoma, and multiple myeloma.
He discovered that patients with colorectal cancer would be an ideal group for treatment with Sapience's novel peptide due to the prevalence of a mutation in the Wnt signaling pathway that causes its excessive activation and promotes cancer formation. According to healthcare consultant Strauss from the Marwood Group, colorectal cancer shows the most promising potential for revenue based on projections, and it has the largest population among the five types of cancer studied. Kappel explains that Sapience's therapeutic approach focuses on targeting protein-protein interactions (PPIs) that are essential for cancer cell survival or that suppress the immune system's response to cancerous tumors.
Sapience focuses on interactions that are difficult to target with traditional drugs due to their location within cells. Peptides offer a promising solution as they have properties of both small and large molecules, making them capable of disrupting intracellular PPIs. This has the potential to improve outcomes for cancer patients and possibly others with various diseases. Robert Friedman, an adjunct professor in the biotechnology program, and Strauss advisor, highlighted the significance of Strauss's presentation in showcasing the Katz School's emphasis on translating scientific knowledge into practical decisions in the biotechnology field.
Avi's comprehensive knowledge of scientific clinical development and market dynamics played a crucial role in the successful completion of the project. He highlighted that the market forecast model he created will be a key tool for the client's long-term corporate planning.

Above all, it reignited her ability to dream.
Students studying Digital Marketing and Media are conducting research on consumer perceptions of sustainability in the fashion industry for a grant-funded project with the City of New York.
As the fashion industry grapples with its role in the climate crisis, the idea of sustainable clothing, including repurposing old garments and reengineering used fabrics, is gaining traction among American consumers. This shift towards sustainability has motivated students in the Digital Marketing and Media program at the Katz School of Science and Health to conduct research on sustainability and apply their findings to the fashion industry. This initiative is part of a grant-funded project for the City of New York, showcasing the students' dedication to exploring innovative solutions for a more environmentally conscious future.
The project combines a practical study on social responsibility with an investigation into harmful practices in the fashion industry. It was proposed by Paul Russo, the dean of the Katz School of Science and Health, aligning with the school's vision to promote a smarter, safer, and healthier world. Researchers Lavanya Karanth, Carli Muller, Alexandra Stern, and Christine Vulpescu aim to enhance consumer interest in sustainable clothing by studying and analyzing consumer attitudes, motivations, and behaviors.
Fast fashion retailers have gained immense popularity by constantly releasing affordable and trendy styles that attract fashion-conscious shoppers. However, the fast pace of production and consumer demand for frequent purchases contribute to a significant environmental impact. Millions of pounds of clothing end up in New York City landfills each year, equivalent to filling the Statue of Liberty multiple times over.
Lavanya emphasized the importance of addressing the issue of synthetic fabrics, which currently make up a majority of the textiles in use today. These fabrics, derived from fossil fuels, are not biodegradable, highlighting the urgent need to consider alternative solutions such as clothing circulation and closet sharing in order to protect the environment for future generations.
The increase in clothing waste is directly linked to the rise of fast fashion brands like H&M and Zara, which prioritize selling large quantities of low-priced items. For instance, Zara introduces new designs multiple times a year, expanding beyond the usual seasonal collections of winter, fall, spring, and summer.
The textile industry contributes to a significant percentage of worldwide greenhouse gas emissions and consumes more energy than both aviation and shipping combined, as reported by the United Nations Environment Program. 

The primary objective of the research conducted at the Katz School is to create a marketing study that assesses and quantifies public awareness and perceptions regarding sustainability initiatives. This study aims to design and implement a marketing and educational campaign that will positively influence these attitudes. Additionally, follow-up data will be collected six months after the campaign to evaluate its impact on urban sustainability.
Dean Russo stated that this sophisticated survey of consumer attitudes establishes a link between business social science and commerce. The findings have the potential to inspire the development of innovative and sustainable business models.
Alexandra specified that the target audience for this project would encompass residents of Manhattan and small to midsize apparel businesses. The digital campaign is intended for individuals who already have a positive outlook on sustainable clothing, as well as those who are either neutral or opposed to it.
Alexandra emphasized the importance of understanding the efforts made by marketers and businesses to promote sustainable practices, in addition to studying consumer behavior. Carli Muller added that the team will be examining various research papers from reputable journals on behavioral marketing and consumer behavior to identify the main factors influencing sustainable consumption.
Carli mentioned that in addition to conducting social deep listening to understand consumer awareness and sentiment towards recycling and reusing clothes, the team will also use these insights as the foundation for their quantitative research.
Christine expressed her intention to leverage the knowledge gained from the Digital Marketing and Media program classes in order to achieve significant outcomes during the project. Asaf Hochman, the team advisor, highlighted the Katz School's support for students integrating their academic learning with their personal interests and passions.
He explained that the team's strong commitment to environmental consciousness is motivating them to utilize their marketing expertise to address a significant real-world challenge. New York City boasts a diverse array of marketing clientele, ranging from Wall Street to its millions of small businesses, such as restaurants, theaters, shopping centers, and luxury hotels.

A recent study by two professors from the Katz School M.A. in Physics found that traffic congestion in New York City often starts with localized clusters of delays on certain streets, which then quickly escalate and spread to nearby areas in a chaotic manner.

Additionally, researchers at the Katz School are working on a sophisticated technique to study the crystallization of ice and the role of antifreeze proteins in preventing this process.
Ran Drori, an assistant professor of chemistry at YU Stern College for Women and the Katz School M A in Physics, is conducting research on ice binding proteins, also known as antifreeze proteins. Using a powerful microscope mounted cold stage with temperature control, Dr. Drori is exploring the unique ability of these proteins to both accelerate and inhibit the growth of ice.

Additionally, a paper from the Katz School of Science and Health has been published in the Journal of Applied Physics. This paper introduces a theoretical framework for studying the quantum origins of flexoelectricity, a phenomenon in which electric charges disperse within a material after it has been bent.
Flexoelectricity is a phenomenon where a previously neutral object undergoes significant changes in size, shape, or deformation when subjected to mechanical or other forces. This causes a redistribution of positive and negative charges within the object as electrons migrate, leading to the generation of electric fields.
Fredy Zypman, a professor and chair of the M.A. in physics program, explained that although the net charge remains zero, the ability to separate charges can still have an impact through the electric field created by their dissociation. He authored the article on Quantum Flexoelectric Nanobending.
Many individuals have encountered charge migration during a dry winter day, feeling a shock when touching a metallic doorknob. This spark represents a rapid and forceful transfer of electric charge.
Although charge relocation is a common occurrence in nature, it is often subtle and not easily observed by the naked eye. Flexoelectricity, in particular, is a phenomenon that is so covert that it only becomes apparent in extremely small objects that require highly sensitive instrumentation for detection.
Flexoelectricity exists in all materials, although it is rarely noticeable in everyday occurrences. However, it is more prominent at submicroscopic levels.
Zypman stated that researchers are now actively pursuing experimental validation of flexoelectricity, a phenomenon that has long been speculated upon. This interest has heightened due to the increasing miniaturization of electronics and microchips. Zypman also highlighted the potential far-reaching implications of flexoelectricity in various fields such as biotechnology and energy harvesting.
Flexoelectric materials possess a unique property that allows them to be utilized in a wide range of applications, making them highly desirable in scientific, engineering, and commercial fields. This unlimited potential makes them valuable for various uses, such as sensors and actuators at nanometer scales, with the thickness of a sheet of paper being a helpful point of comparison.
Sensors have the ability to detect subtle movements by directly measuring the voltage generated from a charge separation. On the other hand, actuators operate by converting an input of voltage or charge into physical motion.
Zypman explained that motion can be either linear or angular, each with numerous practical applications.
A submicroscopic autonomous robot, also known as a micro cyborg, is capable of using actuators for movement and sensors for making decisions on how to navigate. These flexoelectric sensors can be utilized not only for movement but also for monitoring the structural stability of a building by accurately measuring its vibrations.
One potential advancement in medical technology could involve pacemakers that are powered by the natural movements of the human body, eliminating the need for lithium batteries. Additionally, research suggests that human bones possess flexoelectric properties.
Zypman emphasized the importance of understanding the role of the flexoelectric field in guiding the behavior of bone-forming cells when microfractures occur during exercise. He stressed the need for further research to establish clear connections between theory and experiments in order to accurately assess real-world applications.
As the utilization of flexoelectricity in nanodevices continues to expand, it is becoming increasingly crucial. The ongoing advancements in this field represent an exciting and promising area of research.
A team of researchers from the Katz School specializing in mathematics and physics have created a theoretical model to forecast the shapes and gravitational forces of asteroids. Their findings, recently published in the prestigious journal Astrophysics and Space Science, can offer valuable insights for spacecraft engineers working on landing strategies for oddly shaped celestial bodies.
The study received funding from the National Science Foundation. One of the main challenges of the research was to develop mathematical expressions to accurately represent the varying gravitational forces on irregularly shaped asteroids, as opposed to the constant gravity experienced on Earth. This was highlighted by Fredy Zypman, a physics professor and co-author of the paper "Surface Gravity of Rotating Dumbbell Shapes", along with Marian Gidea, professor and chair of the Mathematics programs, and Wai Ting Lam, a mathematics doctoral alum who is now a faculty member at Yeshiva University Stern College for Women.
Asteroids within our solar system come in a multitude of shapes, making them a fascinating subject for scientists and explorers alike due to their abundance of valuable minerals.
Lam found the investigation of irregular gravity fields to be captivating. Specifically, dumbbell shapes have been observed in comets and asteroids.
The researchers at the Katz School studied asteroids with dumbbell or peanut shapes, noting that their uneven mass distribution can result in widely varying gravitational fields across their surfaces. This is in contrast to Earth, which has a nearly round shape and produces a relatively consistent gravitational field. Gidea noted that the observation of dumbbell shapes in comets and asteroids makes them intriguing from both an astronomical and mathematical perspective.
Due to the complex and irregular gravitational field of certain asteroids, spacecrafts must exercise caution when approaching them. Some examples of these oddly shaped asteroids include Hektor, the largest Jupiter Trojan asteroid with its own moon, and Comet Hartley, which was the target of a NASA flyby.
The Deep Impact spacecraft observed the trans-Neptunian object Arrokoth (also known as Ultima Thule) in the Kuiper Belt, which was the focus of the New Horizons space probe flyby. In addition to studying the effects of gravity on peanut-shaped objects, we developed a model to describe the shape of Hektor using simple equations.
Gidea explained that this formula provides a range of shapes that could be observed in this particular type of asteroid. She also noted that not all peanut-shaped asteroids are the same.
Our task was to determine the quantity and types of shapes present, and then calculate the gravitational pull at various points surrounding these shapes. Zypman explained that the researchers also investigated how an asteroid's shape is altered by its rotation.
Understanding the formation of the asteroid in its early malleable stages is crucial for grasping its current shape. Lea Ferreira dos Santos, a physics professor and chair of the physics department at Stern College for Women, has been honored with two prestigious awards that will greatly aid her in advancing the computational study of quantum systems involving multiple bodies.
Santos was awarded a National Science Foundation grant to investigate Nonequilibrium Quantum Matter Timescales and Self Averaging. This collaborative project between the NSF and the U Israel Binational Science Foundation (BSF) aims to facilitate international research collaboration by reducing barriers.
Under the lead agency model, U and Israeli researchers can jointly submit a collaborative proposal for review by NSF. This partnership allows for the integration of different expertise and will enhance the resources available to the NSF PI group, including computer resources.
This collaboration will provide Yeshiva University undergraduate students with the valuable opportunity to engage in research at a prestigious Ph.D.-granting institution in Israel. Additionally, this award will fund computational and theoretical studies focused on the evolution of complex systems with numerous interacting particles, all of which are governed by quantum mechanics.
Many-body quantum systems are incredibly intricate, making it difficult to analyze their evolution using traditional methods. This complexity often requires us to rely on numerical techniques for a more accurate understanding. However, even with numerical approaches, the challenges presented by these systems remain significant.
The complexity of the systems increases exponentially with size, causing existing computers to quickly reach their memory capacity. Consequently, despite their widespread use, these systems remain poorly understood.
Studying the properties of many-body quantum systems that are not in equilibrium is a crucial and fascinating problem that spans across various fields such as atomic, molecular, and condensed matter physics, quantum information, and cosmology. These investigations could potentially have practical applications as well.
Santos was chosen as a Simons Fellow in Theoretical Physics by the Simons Foundation, a prestigious organization committed to pushing the boundaries of research in mathematics and the natural sciences. This honor includes a grant to help fund research during sabbatical breaks from teaching and administrative duties. Selection is based on the applicant's scientific achievements in the five years leading up to the application, as well as the potential impact of the research to be conducted during the sabbatical.
Santos' upcoming project will focus on Nonequilibrium Quantum Dynamics of Many Body Systems. She expressed that the grant will provide her with the opportunity to enhance her current research on nonequilibrium quantum dynamics by enabling her to start a new research line, create computer codes, enhance existing collaborations, establish new ones, and write proposals. Santos is not only excited about the recognition these awards bring to Yeshiva University, but also for the opportunity they provide to further develop her career.
I am thrilled that she recognized the impact of the NSF grant on my undergraduate students at Stern College, as it will provide them with the opportunity to collaborate with industry leaders from both countries. Receiving the Simons fellowship is a great honor, and I am grateful to be counted among the esteemed individuals who have received this prestigious award in the past.

A study conducted at the Renal Research Institute in collaboration with the Katz School of Science and Health has revealed that following current recommendations for ultrafiltration in hemodialysis therapy could increase the risk of death for heavier patients. The research, published in the Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology by Ariella Mermelstein, a Mathematics graduate, and Jochen Raimann, an adjunct professor in Biotechnology Management and Entrepreneurship, highlights the potential dangers of using the current threshold of milliliters per hour per kilogram of body weight as the maximum ultrafiltration rate in hemodialysis therapy for heavier individuals.
Discover Samuel Akingbade's research on harnessing energy from small vibrations in human and natural activity in the Katz School blog, supported by an NSF grant.
Akingbade is developing a mathematical model to optimize the external force applied to energy harvesting devices, such as oscillating beams in structures like skyscrapers, trains, and bridges. This model aims to overcome the internal friction that inhibits the beams from vibrating, thus maximizing the production of electric charge from piezoelectric materials.
Three researchers from the Katz School specializing in mathematics and physics have created a theoretical model to forecast the shapes and gravitational forces of asteroids. Their findings, which were published in the prestigious journal Astrophysics and Space Science in March, could prove invaluable for engineers designing spacecraft landings on irregularly shaped celestial bodies. This groundbreaking research was made possible through a generous grant from the National Science Foundation.
The primary challenge we faced in our research was developing mathematical expressions to accurately represent the varying gravitational forces on irregularly shaped asteroids. Unlike on Earth, gravity on these objects is not consistent. This was a collaborative effort led by Fredy Zypman, a physics professor, along with Marian Gidea, a mathematics professor, and Wai Ting Lam, a former doctoral student in mathematics who is now a faculty member at Yeshiva University Stern College for Women. It is important to understand the complexities of gravity on asteroids of different shapes in order to gain a deeper insight into their behavior in the solar system.
Scientists and explorers are particularly intrigued by these areas due to their abundance of minerals. Lam noted that the study of the unique gravity fields is truly captivating.
The researchers at the Katz School studied asteroids and comets that have a dumbbell or peanut shape, which can result in varying gravitational fields across their surfaces due to uneven mass distribution. This is in contrast to Earth, which has a more uniform mass distribution and therefore a relatively constant gravitational field.
"Dumbbells are one of the unique shapes that researchers have observed in comets and asteroids, making them intriguing from both astronomical and mathematical perspectives," stated Gidea. 

Due to the complex gravitational field of asteroids, spacecrafts must approach them with caution and precision to navigate their irregularities.
Some unique examples of irregularly shaped asteroids include Hektor, the largest Jupiter Trojan asteroid with its own moon, Comet Hartley, which was the focus of a NASA Deep Impact spacecraft flyby, and the trans-Neptunian object Arrokoth (Ultima Thule) in the Kuiper Belt, which was the target of the New Horizons space probe flyby.
Furthermore, in addition to the overall findings regarding the effects of gravity on peanut-shaped objects, we have developed a model to describe the shape of Hektor using straightforward equations. Gidea explains that this formula offers a range of potential shapes for this particular type of asteroid.
Not all peanut-shaped asteroids are the same. We needed to determine the quantity and variety of these shapes, and then calculate the gravitational force at different points near them.
Zypman explained that the researchers also examined how an asteroid's shape evolves with its rotation, shedding light on the object's formation process when it was still flexible and taking on its current form.
"Currently, the data is not available."
The department faculty explores a wide range of analytical tools, such as topological geometry, functional analysis, optimization theory, complexity theory, and various types of differential equations. They also delve into noncommutative geometry, operator algebras, risk theory, and ergodic theory.

During her time in the M in Physician Assistant Studies program, Eliana Zachter found herself preparing for a cesarean section with her surgical team at Bellevue Hospital. She was given a warning by the resident physician about the amount of blood that she would likely encounter during the procedure.
Zachter, who had volunteered in high school at a hospital in the neonatal intensive care and maternity units, remained calm and composed. In the artificial glow of the hospital lights, she skillfully placed a retractor through an incision made by the surgeon in the patient's lower abdomen, holding it open with precision to allow clear access to the woman's uterus.
Zachter reflected on how the Katz School PA program had equipped him for the fast-paced environment he was currently in. As he utilized his clinical skills and medical knowledge, he remained focused on the patient's well-being on the operating table.

Marsha Pinto, a speech pathologist with a Master's degree in Speech Language Pathology, received a referral last year for a one-year-old student with selective mutism, an anxiety disorder that prevents him from speaking in specific social situations. The student not only refused to speak, but also avoided entering the classroom altogether, lingering by the door to avoid the attention of his classmates.
A total of sixty-four students from the Speech Language Pathology and Occupational Therapy Doctorate programs graduated together at the main commencement ceremony at the Katz School in May. Following the ceremony, they gathered for their own special white coat and pinning ceremonies to celebrate their achievements.

During her speech to the graduates, Marissa Barrera, assistant dean of health sciences and director of the medical SLP program, emphasized the significance of wearing the white coat. She explained that by donning the white coat, graduates were making a commitment to uphold integrity in all aspects of their work, serving as a promise to themselves, their profession, their patients, and humanity as a whole.
Henry Hecker's career was cut short by a brain injury, leaving him unable to speak. However, during a recent Zoom call, he was determined to regain his voice with the help of two students from the Katz School M in Speech Language Pathology. In a similar vein, Marissa Barrera, the director of the program, provided expert training in screening for swallowing disorders, known as dysphagia, to registered dietitians and nutritionists at the Food and Nutrition Conference Expo (FNCE) in October. Anne also lost her ability to speak after suffering a stroke.
Anne struggled with aphasia, a condition that made it difficult for her to find the right words and form coherent sentences. Dani Weingarten, a graduate of the Katz School in Speech Language Pathology (SLP), took on her case and helped her overcome these challenges. Weingarten, who also teaches at YU Stern College for Women, recalled that when she first met Anne, she couldn't even say her own name.
She struggled to articulate her emotions, until one day she mustered the courage to ask Anne to sing.

Additionally, he obtained both an LL.B. and a B.A. from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.
During their residency, candidates must participate in a one-credit J.D. colloquium led by faculty members from Cardozo School of Law. This course aims to facilitate collaborative review and discussion of student research, teach fundamental research techniques, and foster a sense of community among students and the School. Additionally, this year's research-focused program expects candidates to produce a substantial piece of writing of publishable quality that offers a noteworthy and innovative contribution to legal scholarship.
First-year candidates in the J.D. program are required to reside on campus and take part in the J.D. Colloquium. They must also work with faculty advisors to fulfill all necessary coursework requirements. Additionally, candidates must commit to spending at least their first two semesters at the Cardozo School of Law.
In the second year of the program, candidates start working on their dissertations and seek guidance from faculty advisors and J D committee members. Additionally, they are required to complete extra coursework under the supervision of a faculty member.
In order to earn a J.D. degree, students must complete an advanced dissertation project with guidance from a faculty advisor. Candidates are also expected to begin their research and create a preliminary outline of their dissertation with the help of their advisors.
Each committee will determine the specific requirements for the monograph, which should make an original contribution to legal scholarship, showcase advanced research skills, and have the potential to be published as a book or series of law review articles.

The Albert Einstein College of Medicine and Cardozo School of Law collaborate to provide a unique opportunity for law students to earn a joint J.D. and M.S. in Bioethics. The dissertation submitted by the students must be reviewed and approved by the J.D. Committee to ensure it contributes significantly to legal academic scholarship.
To earn both a J.D. and M.A. in Bioethics, students must dedicate at least three years to their studies, with the possibility of an additional summer semester or year. Upon completion of the written dissertation, students will need to assemble their committee for an oral defense before receiving final approval.
Students who are interested in pursuing the J.D. and M.A. in Bioethics should reach out to the finance offices at Cardozo and Einstein as soon as possible, as their decisions can greatly impact their financial aid. By completing the requirements for both degrees in just two years, students can also benefit from reduced tuition costs.
Students should confirm the current limit with the Cardozo Registrar and advising Dean. The time it takes to complete the program will vary based on the student's ability to effectively coordinate coursework that applies to both the J.D. and M.A. in Bioethics.
This fee includes tuition for Bioethics courses at Einstein for three full-time years in the Cardozo program, as well as one additional term in the summer, fall, or spring. Full-time Cardozo students may have their tuition cover registration for Einstein courses during the six full-time semesters of the J.D. program, up to the per semester credit cap set by the ABA, which will be monitored by the Cardozo Registrar.
To earn the M degree, students must earn credits, with half of them coming from Bioethics courses offered by Einstein. Additionally, Cardozo J.D./M students are required to pay a fixed tuition fee upon official admission into the program.
Any courses taken outside of the Capstone Thesis project will incur additional charges at the per-credit rate.
Please refer to the Range of Courses section on this website for a list of courses that may be relevant to your studies. Two mandatory Bioethics courses, Bioethics and Medical Humanities I, must be completed consecutively in the fall and spring semesters of a designated academic year.
During the initial year of the J.D. program at Cardozo, students usually do not have the chance to take courses that count towards the M degree. However, the remaining credits can be fulfilled by selecting a personalized combination of elective courses available at both Einstein and Cardozo.
JDM students often face a decision in their academic path. They can either dedicate their second year to fulfilling M requirements with Cardozo courses and wait until their third year to focus on Bioethics courses, or they can start integrating Bioethics courses into their second year. It is important for students to have open conversations and receive approval from the Dean at Cardozo regarding the Bioethics courses at Einstein that can be credited towards their JDM degree. Increasing the number of approved Bioethics courses can help students manage their course load effectively in the second and third years.
As previously mentioned, there is a limit set by the ABA on the number of credits a J.D. student can take each semester. After the first year, students should work with the appropriate Dean at Cardozo to plan their second and third years in a way that allows for flexibility and progression towards both their J.D. and M. degrees. It is important to note that half of the M credits must be earned through Bioethics courses offered by Einstein.
Please confirm the current credit limit with the Cardozo Registrar and advising dean. One important decision for a J.D./M.S. student will be whether to fulfill the two-semester course requirement for Bioethics and Medical Humanities I during their second or third year.
However, students frequently require an additional semester to complete their Capstone Thesis project. The Cardozo Registrar will ensure that the maximum number of credits is not exceeded.
Students who choose to work on their capstone thesis during the summer must prioritize effectively balancing their responsibilities with their project advisor and law internships. Due to the credit cap per semester, students have taken initiative in seeking approval from Cardozo to have more BIOE courses count towards their J.D. requirements.
Dear Students, Faculty, Staff, and Friends, 

I am excited to share with you our guide outlining the plans for the upcoming fall semester and the reopening of our campuses. In the event that advanced planning indicates the necessity of an additional term, we highly encourage students to consider scheduling this term during the summer between their second and third years.

To our valued Students, Faculty, Staff, and Friends, I am delighted to share with you our plans for the upcoming fall semester and the reopening of our campuses through this Guide.
There are four primary sources of graduate funding at YU, with options such as merit-based partial scholarships or assistantships available. Investing in your graduate education is important, but the cost of tuition and living expenses can often feel daunting for many students.
For specific information about the details of federal aid available for graduate programs at yu.edu, please contact the admissions office for the program you are interested in. Federal aid is available for domestic students who are eligible US citizens and non-citizens. It is important to note that, unlike undergraduate students, graduate students are not eligible to receive federal grants.
The Department of Education mandates that every university determine a comprehensive cost of attendance for their programs. This financial support is accessible to both domestic and international students.
The Yeshiva University Office of Student Finance oversees the distribution of student loans, including federal aid. In order to be considered for financial assistance, you must submit a Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) each academic year that you are enrolled.
The FAFSA utilizes the information from your income tax return. This office specializes in providing detailed information on federal financial aid and their assistance for graduate students.
These loans do not necessitate a credit check and offer advantages such as a steady yearly interest rate, a six-month grace period, and deferment options to support your success in repayment. In order to qualify for federal financial aid, your eligibility for awards is determined by your tax return from two years prior.
Graduate students may incur a loan origination fee deducted by the Department of Education before the university receives the funds. Additionally, graduate students have access to two primary types of federal loans, with Federal Direct Unsubsidized Loans being available regardless of financial need.
In order to qualify for Graduate Plus Loans, a credit check is necessary. The maximum amount that can be borrowed per academic year, including summer, fall, and spring semesters, is determined based on individual circumstances.
When borrowing federal loans, the amount you borrow should not exceed the total cost of attendance as determined by the university, including direct and indirect expenses.
If your application for a Plus Loan is denied because of adverse credit, you have the option to include an endorser who will act as a co-signer on the loan. Alternatively, you can also submit an appeal to the Department of Education.

Furthermore, you have the opportunity to borrow additional funds beyond your tuition and fees to cover expenses like books, lab fees, and other educational costs.
Graduate students often turn to Graduate PLUS Loans when they require additional funding beyond their yearly limit, using these loans to bridge the financial gap. The Graduate PLUS Loan provides a stable annual interest rate.
Grad Plus Loans can provide valuable feedback on areas that may need improvement before conducting a second credit review.
Learn more about federal loans, including important details like interest rates and repayment timelines. Keep in mind that there is a loan origination fee deducted from your loan amount by the Department of Education before the university receives the funds.
Afterwards, please remember to revisit the YU website in order to fill out the Federal Unsubsidized Loan Request Form. It is important to note that graduate students do not qualify for Pell Grants or Direct Subsidized Stafford Loans.
After your federal loans are approved, you will receive a set of instructions on the StudentLoans.gov portal. To apply for federal loans, you must complete the FAFSA or Renewal FAFSA. Visit the Office of Student Finance website for detailed steps on how to apply for and accept your Unsubsidized Loan.
We recommend completing the FAFSA Entrance Counseling and Master Promissory Notes (MPNs) by March to allow ample time to arrange your finances before the fall semester begins. If you are applying for a Graduate Plus Loan, you will need to return to StudentLoans.gov for the final steps.
One way to lessen or eliminate your student debt is by taking advantage of loan repayment and forgiveness programs. Additionally, the new FAFSA for the upcoming fall semester will be available in October.
Public service jobs that qualify for loan forgiveness usually consist of positions such as ____. It is important to mention that loan forgiveness is only applicable to Federal Direct Unsubsidized Loans and does not apply to GradPlus Loans or private loans. Additionally, Master Promissory Notes (MPNs) remain valid for multiple years, Entrance Counseling is completed once, and the FAFSA must be filed annually.
Furthermore, with the implementation of loan forgiveness by Congress, there is always a possibility that it may be reversed. Individuals who work in qualifying public service positions for a decade and consistently make loan payments may qualify for loan forgiveness.
There are various types of loan forgiveness programs offered by federal agencies or state governments based on your field of study and public service. It is important to note that these programs are separate from any university, so it is your responsibility to ensure you meet the eligibility criteria, make the necessary payments, and apply for loan forgiveness after a certain period of time.
Discover and apply for various opportunities for loan forgiveness through the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program on the official U.S. Department of Education website.
Please remember to disclose any external financial assistance, such as scholarships, grants, or fellowships, to the Office of Student Finance. This includes any funding received from sources other than the university or government.
Please be aware that we do not support or endorse any external funding sources, and we are unable to provide help with applying for these opportunities. Additionally, any grants received may be disbursed directly to you, and it is your responsibility to allocate this money towards paying your bills.
Please reach out to the admissions office for further information. Additionally, we have compiled a list of external funding sources for you to explore, and the U Department of Education also provides a list for your review.
Completing a CPT is a requirement for students enrolled in their degree program, and it can be either paid or unpaid. International students are not able to submit a FAFSA, but they may qualify for institutional aid based on the program they are interested in.
Government agencies, companies, or other organizations in your home country may offer financial support. F visa holders may qualify for Curricular Practical Training (CPT) to work full or part time in a field related to their academic program.
Canadian students are encouraged to inquire with their province about the availability of provincial loans and private student lines of credit. Before beginning any employment under Curricular Practical Training (CPT), approval must be obtained from a designated school official (DSO) at York University, and a signed agreement from the employer must be submitted.
Please fill out the Yeshiva University Consent to Participate in Electronic Transactions Form in order to participate in electronic transactions. Additionally, there are international organizations that provide financial assistance to students worldwide.

The Cardozo Arts Entertainment Law Journal has been recognized as a top publication in the Entertainment Arts and Sports Law category, ranking first in journal cites, second in Scholarly Impact, and third in Cites by Courts. At a recent presentation at the International Congress of Industrial and Applied Mathematics in Tokyo, Marian Gidea, the association dean for STEM research and director of graduate mathematics at the Katz School, shared findings from a simplified mathematical model. This model demonstrated that oscillating steel beams made of piezoelectric materials generate more energy when their motion is regular. Additionally, the Cardozo Law Review was established in the inaugural year of the School of Law's existence.
The term "piezoelectric" originates from the Greek root "piezo," meaning pressure or push. It refers to a unique property found in certain solid materials that allows them to convert energy from applied pressure into an electrical charge. According to the Washington Lee Law School database, it is ranked th among journal citations.
The researchers developed a new framework where two steel beams are connected to a capacitor and hung above magnets. The research project, "Energy Growth Dissipation and Control in Hamiltonian Systems," is being funded by a three-year National Science Foundation grant awarded in July. This grant will support investigations into dynamical systems with a focus on energy harvesting, celestial mechanics, and space mission design.
Gidea expressed astonishment at the discovery that the answer obtained aligned perfectly with what was anticipated. The computer model was a result of the joint efforts of Tamar Leiser, who conducted her honor thesis on the subject while studying at YU Stern School for Women, Samuel Akingbade, a Ph.D. student in mathematics at Katz School, and research partners from Georgia Tech and Polytechnic University of Catalunya.
Piezoelectric energy harvesting is the ideal choice for powering wearable devices due to its ability to efficiently generate power on a small scale. When the vibration of the beams exceeds mechanical friction, electricity is generated and stored in the capacitor.
Utilizing piezoelectricity has the potential to greatly reduce or completely eliminate the necessity for frequent charging of devices and batteries. Devices that harness energy from regular, consistent movements, such as beams oscillating back and forth, are able to accumulate more energy than those that move erratically. Energy harvesting devices, which generate electrical charges from external vibrations, can be installed on skyscrapers, trains, or bridges to create a sustainable and limitless source of renewable energy.
Gidea believes that implanting these devices in pacemakers could be a significant breakthrough for healthcare. The steel beams in the Katz School model were coated with ceramic, which is the ideal material for energy harvesting due to its cost-effectiveness and strong piezoelectric properties.
The Center will provide professional care for English-speaking gap year students and Israelis, offering crucial mental health counseling during extended lockdowns and the added stresses of the COVID-19 pandemic and other factors. This will alleviate the need for consumers to constantly be near electrical outlets, leading to energy conservation.
In response to the urgent mental health needs of English-speaking immigrants in Israel, the Jerusalem Therapy Center will be established in September through a partnership between Yeshiva University and Amudim Israel. The center will be staffed by a team of Wurzweiler graduate students, recent graduates, and professionals specializing in various modalities such as addiction, anxiety, and trauma. It aims to provide affordable and accessible mental health services to those affected by the pandemic, gap year students, and new immigrants adjusting to life in Israel.
This unique opportunity allows for alignment with the University's overarching goal of supporting the community in Israel. The Center will be a collaborative effort between the Wurzweiler School of Social Work and Amudim Israel, an organization dedicated to providing social services for individuals and families affected by trauma, addiction, and other challenging mental health issues.
These students are experiencing independence for the first time, separated from their families and usual support systems. Unfortunately, their temporary health insurance does not usually cover mental health counseling. Selma Botman, provost and vice president for academic affairs, emphasized that Wurzweiler plays a unique role in educating future mental health professionals while also offering essential services to the community in Israel.
Navigating mental health issues can be challenging for members of the English-speaking community in Israel. YU, a prestigious institution, is dedicated to offering top-notch training, support, and expertise to those in need. Gap year students who come to Israel straight out of high school will receive special attention from the Center.
In response to the difficulties encountered by English speakers in Israel, in May Wurzweiler co-hosted a Mental Health Expo in Jerusalem that attracted a large number of participants. The Center aims to offer crucial, affordable, and high-quality mental health services to this vulnerable population.
Nechama Munk, senior program director of Wurzweiler in Israel, emphasized the urgent need for mental health services in our community. She highlighted the difficulties in diagnosing and treating mental health issues, especially when trying to find English-speaking practitioners. Navigating and understanding the mental health services provided through the health system can also be challenging.
Accessing high-quality and affordable healthcare can be difficult for all Israelis, especially for those who do not speak Hebrew as their first language. The overwhelming demand for services was a key factor in the decision to establish the Jerusalem Therapy Center.
Research has indicated a rise in anxiety and depression since the start of the pandemic, underscoring the urgent need for countries to enhance mental health resources and assistance. As an organization, our core principle is to assist those experiencing hardship, and the Therapy Center is committed to providing comfort and optimism to those in need.
During times of shutdown, individuals experiencing loneliness felt even more isolated, while those battling depression saw their struggles intensify. This highlights the crucial need for accessible and effective mental health services.
The Jerusalem Therapy Center offers a valuable opportunity for Wurzweiler graduate students to participate in clinical fieldwork placements conducted in English. Under the guidance of seasoned clinicians, students can enhance their skills while also contributing to the community. Additionally, although Munk noted that COVID did not introduce new mental health challenges, it did intensify preexisting issues.
Yeshiva University defied national trends by achieving record success at the end of the academic year, with a significant increase in undergraduate enrollment from fall to fall. Additionally, the Center will provide support to overlooked demographics, including soldiers dealing with PTSD and individuals facing financial, cultural, and psychological challenges during their transition to Israel.
The competition for admission has intensified. Moreover, the Jerusalem Therapy Center will offer training and enrichment seminars for gap year administrators, educators, directors, and therapists, equipping them with the necessary tools to acquire new skills and effectively support students facing challenges.
The growth in both quantity and quality is a significant contrast to the nationwide decline in college enrollment, which saw a steep drop from to , marking the worst decline in enrollment on record. This positive trend is anticipated to persist in the fall, as applications have increased by over percent compared to last year.
Rabbi Ari Berman, President and Rosh Yeshiva of Yeshiva University, emphasized that everything we do at Yeshiva is done with the utmost respect for heaven. The current applicants demonstrate impressive academic accomplishments, including high GPAs, test scores, and enrollment in honors classes.
We are grateful for the opportunity to be ambassadors of Hashem, serving our community and society by educating the future leaders with integrity and excellence. The significant increase in applications to YU reflects the growing recognition of the exceptional value offered by a Yeshiva University education, which seamlessly integrates a top-tier yeshiva with a prestigious university.
Other prestigious universities featured on the list include MIT, Caltech, and Dartmouth. Our success in increasing enrollment, improving rankings, and receiving philanthropic support is truly a testament to our hard work and dedication.
Employers are increasingly recognizing the value of a degree from YU, as evidenced by the significant growth in enrollment. This surge can be attributed to YU's rise in the U.S. News & World Report Best Colleges ranking, which now places it among top universities with a smaller undergraduate enrollment.

Parents are increasingly aware of the importance of providing their children with a Jewish education and environment to help shape their identity as they transition into adulthood, according to Geri Mansdorf, Assistant Vice President of Enrollment. The college years are crucial for personal development, and the environment during this time greatly influences who a person becomes as an adult. This is especially significant for students who have returned from immersive Torah study in Israel.

Unlike undergraduate students, graduate students are responsible for finding and applying for their own financial aid opportunities. There is no standard financial aid package available for graduate students.
Financial support in the form of loans provided by private entities, rather than government sources, is known as institutional aid.
In order to receive financial aid, it is necessary to fill out the FAFSA annually. Federal aid funding, provided by the U.S. government, is typically in the form of loans and is only available to U.S. citizens and permanent residents.
FAFSA code: This code is used to apply for financial aid from sources outside the university or government, such as scholarships, grants, or fellowships.

For more information on graduate tuition fees at OSF, please visit www.yu.edu/graduate or reach out to Nancy O Barr, the OSF graduate admissions representative, at nancy.obarr@yu.edu. Additionally, all U.S. citizens and permanent residents seeking federal aid are required to submit a Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) at www.fafsa.gov.
In order to qualify for federal financial aid from the government, you must be a U.S. citizen or eligible noncitizen, be enrolled at least half time in a degree program, complete the FAFSA annually, not be in default on federal loans or owe a refund on a federal grant, and maintain Satisfactory Academic Progress. Federal Stafford Loans do not require a credit check and offer benefits such as a fixed interest rate, grace period, and deferment options to assist with repayment. Your eligibility for aid is determined by your previous year's tax return.
Students can borrow additional funds beyond their cost of attendance to cover expenses like books, lab fees, and other educational costs. International students cannot apply for FAFSA, but they can still apply for Katz School scholarships.
For detailed information on federal financial aid, please reach out to the Office of Student Finance. Additionally, students from outside the U.S. can inquire about scholarship opportunities from their home countries with our support.

The Yeshiva University Patent Policy aligns with fundamental principles and goals, aiming to support scientific exploration and promote ongoing research efforts. YU acknowledges that the innovative work carried out by its faculty, technical staff, and students may result in valuable inventions and discoveries that warrant patenting or licensing for various reasons.
In order to support innovation and ensure that the Inventor receives proper recognition and rewards, reports submitted with the Yeshiva University Invention Disclosure Form should be detailed enough for the invention to be comprehensively assessed for potential patent filing or commercial licensing agreement development.
For research that is funded, the Committee on Patents must be informed of any requirements for disclosing inventions from the agency providing the funding. This will help support YU's facilities, research, and education programs through income generated from commercial licensing of inventions and patents.
Yeshiva University retains ownership of all patents, copyrights, software, and other intellectual property resulting from research conducted by faculty, staff, or students with university resources. Inventions must be disclosed to the Provost or the Committee on Patents promptly after conception or first reduction to practice.
When faculty or staff members agree to participate in government-sponsored research, they must sign agreements that allow YU to fulfill its responsibilities to the sponsoring agencies. YU will compensate the inventor with a set percentage of the profits generated from the licensing or use of the intellectual property, as outlined in Section F.
The text provided is already clear and doesn't need any improvement.
Works that are created independently and not as part of their job duties, and are not produced using resources provided by YU, such as academic papers and books, will be owned by the author. The ownership of any intellectual property that arises from research conducted by a visiting faculty member and is funded in whole or in part by YU resources will be decided on a case-by-case basis.
YU will retain all authority over decisions and processes related to managing patent applications and patents. Any Intellectual Property generated from inventions and discoveries made by faculty members, technical staff, or students in government-sponsored research contracts, grants, fellowships, or similar agreements will be governed by the terms of those agreements.
Yeshiva University will promptly compensate the inventor for income received from licensing their Intellectual Property to a third party. Yeshiva University is responsible for managing patent applications and patents.
Before seeking licenses for commercial development of Intellectual Property, YU will deduct all direct expenses related to filing, prosecuting, and maintaining relevant patents, as well as negotiating contracts for licensing, including specialized attorney fees. The licenses will be sought to ensure that useful inventions are made available under reasonable terms in products or services beneficial to the public.
After subtracting direct expenses, fifteen percent of the remaining income will be allocated to the Office of Biotechnology to cover operating costs. All licensing agreements will be negotiated by the Albert Einstein College of Medicine Office of Biotechnology and authorized by an appropriate Einstein officer.
If an Inventor leaves Yeshiva University, they are required to provide YU with updated forwarding addresses. YU will determine any associated expenses at their discretion, ensuring they are fair and reasonable.
: 

A portion of the net income will be designated for a research account managed by Yeshiva University to support the academic research endeavors of any inventor who is primarily affiliated with YU. The rest of the net income will be distributed according to the following guidelines:
If an Inventor departs from YU, the research account will be transferred back to YU and the Provost will decide how to manage the funds and any future income. All payments owed to an Inventor will be made separately from the payroll system.
One third of the funds will be designated for Yeshiva University's unrestricted funds, to support the university's educational, research, and clinical endeavors. The inventor research allocation specified above, along with the indirect costs associated with this allocation, will be determined for each license.
An exception to the standard income distribution method outlined earlier will be allowed in the instance of Intellectual Property generated from sponsored research, if the agreement between Yeshiva University and the sponsor prohibits such distribution. Additionally, the initial portion of cumulative income will be exempt from indirect costs.
This exception will be applicable to funding from both government and non-government sources. The latter will be subject to indirect costs at half the current institutional rate.
In the event that there are multiple inventors of intellectual property, they must come together to determine the distribution of income among themselves as outlined in Section F. Any income exceeding a certain threshold will be subject to indirect costs at the current institutional rate.
Dispute resolution methods can involve mediation, arbitration, or other services provided by the Committee on Patents. The specific terms of the agreement with the sponsor will determine the course of action in such cases.
After selling the equity, the resulting cash will be distributed based on the guidelines outlined in Section F. If there are any disagreements among the Inventors about their individual ownership stakes, the Provost will resolve the dispute.
Einstein's goal is not to prioritize profit maximization when holding equity. Any recommendations or decisions resulting from mediation, arbitration, or the Committee on Patents will undergo review and approval by the Provost, with his final decision being binding.
This statement must be submitted before or at the same time as submitting a paper for publication and will disclose any Intellectual Property. YU will sell such equity in the public market at the first available opportunity for liquidity.
In order to protect our invention, it is important to prepare and file a patent application before publicly disclosing any information about it.
Upon request or as stipulated in the agreement, YU will provide a sponsor with a pre-publication copy of the proposed publication. The publication rights for research involving Intellectual Property will be granted under the condition that YU does not restrict or prevent the publication of disclosures and inventions for which patent applications have been submitted.
One of the key responsibilities of the Committee is to recommend to the Dean of AECOM and/or the Provost of Yeshiva University which Intellectual Property should be processed according to the Policy on Patents and Licensing Agreements. These recommendations should be made promptly, within days of the Committee being informed of the Intellectual Property. Additionally, it is important for an Inventor to fulfill their obligation by submitting an Invention Disclosure Statement to Yeshiva University as soon as possible.
In order to align proposals for patenting Intellectual Property with YU's mission, it is important to provide general recommendations. The inventor must disclose their invention to YU at least a certain number of days before any public disclosure, whether in printed or oral form.
The text provided is incomplete. Could you please provide more context or additional information so that I can rewrite it in a better and more meaningful way?
Employees will agree to promptly disclose any Intellectual Property they create to YU in writing and assign all rights to YU as outlined in the Policy on Patents and Licensing Agreements. The Dean of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine will appoint a Committee on Patents and other necessary committees to enforce YU's patent and licensing agreement policies.
It is the responsibility of the Provost to assess whether Intellectual Property shared with YU should be patented or not. This evaluation includes determining if the Intellectual Property was developed using YU resources or if it is unrelated to the university's activities and resources.
If the Provost decides not to pursue a patent, the Inventor retains the option to pursue it. The Inventor also serves as an advisor to the Provost on patents assigned to YU or in which YU has a stake.
The inventor will have the opportunity to pursue a patent. All faculty, students, and research staff at Yeshiva University must sign an agreement acknowledging that they have received and read the Official Policy on Patents and Licensing Agreements and agree to follow it.
If the Inventor chooses to seek patent protection at their own cost, they must: a) promptly inform YU in writing of their intention to pursue patent protection, b) transfer ownership of the Intellectual Property to YU, c) ensure that their patent counsel keeps YU informed of all communications with the United States Patent and Trademark Office, and d) direct any third party interest in the Intellectual Property to YU for licensing purposes. The Provost will communicate this decision to the Inventor in writing within a specified number of days after the disclosure.
Following reimbursement of direct assignable expenses to the Inventor and YU, fifteen percent of the remaining income will be allocated to the Office of Biotechnology to cover its operating costs. In the event that YU chooses to halt the patent application process, the Provost will inform the Inventor in writing within days of this decision.
The first allocation of funds will be designated solely for the Inventor, their estate, or heirs. All relevant information held by YU pertaining to the patent application will be provided to the Inventor.
One third of the income will be set aside for YU. If YU chooses not to pursue a patent for any Intellectual Property or decides to stop pursuing it, YU will still have ownership of that Intellectual Property and any related patent or application.
Patricia Berry, an expert with an MBA, will allocate income derived from a patent declined by Einstein in the following manner:

This requirement is meant for student organizations and clubs to clearly distinguish themselves as such, rather than being mistaken for a University department or unit.

Dr. Ari Berman, President of Yeshiva University, has unveiled Rise Up: The Campaign for Yeshiva University, a multifaceted initiative designed to support scholarships, improve facilities, and enhance faculty and programs in order to ensure the University's ongoing achievement.
Launched on December 5, 2021, the Rise Up campaign seeks to raise $613 million over the next five years to support student success in an evolving landscape. The campaign will focus on York University's key strategic areas, including values and leadership, science and technology, entrepreneurship and innovation, and creating opportunities for meaningful careers.
Dr. Berman's leadership has resulted in a substantial increase in fundraising efforts for Yeshiva University, with annual contributions rising from approximately $30 million in 2018 to $92 million in 2021.
The promises made during the initial phase of the campaign have already led to important endeavors such as providing scholarships for Jewish educators, establishing the Emil A. and Jenny Fish Center for Holocaust and Genocide Studies, and creating the Rabbi Lord Jonathan Sacks Center for Values and Leadership.
The Rise Up campaign in the field of Science and Technology encompasses an array of enhanced initiatives and new programs at the Katz School of Science and Health, with a specific focus on artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, biotechnology and healthcare, digital media, and financial technology.
The Rise Up campaign highlights the importance of entrepreneurship and innovation through various initiatives, such as the Selma T. and Jacques H. Mitrani Foundation Computer Science Lab at Stern College for Women and a newly established digital arts lab on the Wilf Campus.
The campaign also focuses on the importance of creating meaningful and impactful careers, through initiatives like the Shevet Glaubach Center for Career Strategy and Professional Development and enhanced opportunities for undergraduate career preparation.
The Rise Up campaign is led by Sen. Joseph Lieberman and Anita Zucker as co-chairs, along with a dedicated Campaign Cabinet comprising Elliot Gibber, Billy Greenblatt, Andrew Herenstein, Lance Hirt, Ira Mitzner, Ann Pava, and Mark Wilf.

Under the guidance of her supervisor Abraham Oxilas, Gannon applied the skills she acquired in the Katz School's Clinical Skills and Procedures course to successfully suture a leg wound for a patient who had injured himself on a piece of glass.
Utilizing her expertise in suturing techniques, Gannon executed the procedure with confidence, using the interrupted stitch method. This was her first time suturing a live patient, but she managed to close the wound flawlessly, earning praise from both her supervisor and the patient.
Gannon's unwavering commitment to her clinical rotation is exemplified by her willingness to work three 12-hour shifts per week, despite the long commute from the Bronx to Far Rockaway. She demonstrates her dedication to patient care by using her early morning subway rides to mentally prepare while listening to music, and diligently documenting patient notes on her way back home.
Abraham Oxilas praised Gannon for her exceptional adaptability and cultural competence in the high-pressure environment of the emergency room. He specifically recognized her success in her initial rotation and emphasized the Katz School's dedication to training physician assistants who are well-versed in diverse cultures.
Gannon, who is scheduled to graduate in December 2024, eagerly anticipates her upcoming clinical rotation where she will delve into fields such as endocrinology or pediatrics. Although she is eager to gain exposure to various specialties, her current enthusiasm lies in emergency care, where she is inspired by the versatile role of physician assistants.
Rabbi Kook is often compared to Rabbi Dr. Joseph B. Soloveitchik as a significant figure for Israeli religious-Zionists and modern Orthodox American Jews, respectively. How similar were their teachings and influences?
Rav Kook and the Rav are considered to be the most influential thinkers of modern Judaism in the 20th century. They delved into crucial concepts surrounding Jewish nationality, identity, and Zionism, and also engaged in thoughtful discussions on how to effectively engage with secularism in a constructive manner.
During Rav Soloveitchik's sole visit to Israel in 1935, he had the opportunity to meet Rav Kook. This meeting brought back memories for Rav Kook of his time in the yeshiva of Volozhyn, where Rabbi Chaim Soloveitchik, Rav Soloveitchik's grandfather, had taught. Rav Kook later shared with his son Tzvi Yehuda that he could hear the voice of Rabbi Soloveitchik's grandfather in the grandson.
As Rabbi Soloveitchik grew older, he would occasionally reference the teachings of Rav Kook, particularly finding inspiration in his writings on teshuva, or repentance.
Rabbi Kook's writings can be challenging to understand and interpret, often appearing esoteric. Some of his works may present conflicting ideas, leading to questions about the approach taken in his teachings. In the classroom, students may explore a variety of his works to gain a deeper understanding of his philosophy.
Rav Kook came to appreciate the positive efforts of those cultivating Israel, seeing their rejection of religion as stemming from a narrow perspective. He viewed their modern activism as a necessary correction to the passive attitudes prevalent among diasporic Jews.
It is important for students to have a deep understanding of Rav Kook and his teachings, rather than just relying on hearsay. Developing critical thinking skills is also crucial. By analyzing the assumptions underlying Rav Kook's arguments and the societal issues of the 20th century, students gain a greater appreciation for the challenges people faced. Lastly, students should not be afraid to engage directly with the material by reading and interpreting it themselves.
After only two weeks of her clinical rotation at St. John's Episcopal Hospital in Far Rockaway, Queens, Carin Gannon, a student enrolled in the Katz School's M.S. in Physician Assistant Studies program, faced a challenging situation. A local resident had sustained a deep cut on his leg from a piece of glass and was brought into the emergency department with severe bleeding.
Two hours had passed since the injury, and Gannon realized that it hadn't begun to heal on its own. It had been several months since she last practiced suturing in Oxila's Clinical Skills and Procedures course. Noticing the yellowish subcutaneous fatty tissue, she quickly washed her hands with soap, donned a pair of sterile gloves, and retrieved a suturing kit.
After providing instructions, Gannon advised the appreciative patient to monitor for any signs of infection, such as redness spreading up or down his leg. Additionally, he cautioned against using alcohol or hydrogen peroxide to clean the wound. The patient received a tetanus shot and was prescribed antibiotics before heading home.
Oxilas praised Carin for her exceptional interpersonal skills, expertise, and ability to quickly adjust to any situation. He noted that Carin's previous hospital experience has been instrumental in her success in the emergency room during her first rotation, and expressed his pride in her accomplishments.
Gannon's weekly routine consists of working three 12-hour shifts, which requires her to take the subway at 3:30 a.m. to Far Rockaway, a three-hour journey from the Bronx. During her commute, she enjoys listening to her favorite artists, Hozier and Noah Kahan.
According to Oxilas, the Katz School PA program stands out for its dedication to training PAs in cultural competency, enabling them to effectively care for underserved communities with diverse healthcare needs.
In the Katz School PA program, Gannon learned to consider all aspects of patient care, including their physical, psychological, emotional, and spiritual well-being, all of which are essential for their recovery.
Gannon found working in the emergency department and witnessing the impact of PAs to be truly inspiring.

In response to the urgent need for accessible mental health services in Israel, Yeshiva University is partnering with Amudim Israel to establish the Jerusalem Therapy Center in September 2022. This new facility will offer specialized care for English speakers, including gap-year students and Israeli residents, in light of the increased demand for counseling services during the COVID-19 pandemic and other challenging circumstances.
The Jerusalem Therapy Center, a joint effort between the Wurzweiler School of Social Work and Amudim Israel, will be operated by a team of Wurzweiler graduate students, recent graduates, and experienced professionals who specialize in treating addiction, anxiety, and trauma. This collaboration is designed to meet the urgent mental health needs of English-speaking immigrants in Israel, providing assistance to individuals impacted by the pandemic, gap-year students navigating the difficulties of being away from home, and new immigrants adjusting to life in a new country.
Dr. Selma Botman, provost and vice president for academic affairs, highlighted Wurzweiler's special role in training future mental health professionals and offering top-tier services to the community in Israel. This initiative is in line with Yeshiva University's overarching goal of meeting the needs of individuals in Israel, demonstrating the institution's dedication to providing outstanding training, support, and knowledge.
The Center will prioritize providing affordable and high-quality mental health services to gap-year students. This group is especially vulnerable as they are often navigating life away from their families and support systems for the first time. This initiative acknowledges the specific challenges faced by these students, who may not have coverage for mental health counseling under tourist or temporary health insurance, and aims to offer them essential support.
During a recent presentation, Nechama Munk, the senior program director of Wurzweiler in Israel, emphasized the importance of mental health services for the English-speaking community in Israel, particularly during difficult times. The Therapy Center is committed to providing support and hope, recognizing the obstacles faced by all Israelis in accessing quality and affordable treatment, and especially by those who do not speak Hebrew as their first language.
In light of the rising rates of anxiety and depression during the pandemic, the Jerusalem Therapy Center is committed to answering the global demand for enhanced mental health services and support. Although COVID-19 did not introduce new mental health challenges, it has heightened existing issues, underscoring the critical need for accessible and high-quality mental health care.
The Jerusalem Therapy Center will provide support to a diverse range of individuals, including soldiers dealing with PTSD and immigrants facing financial, cultural, and psychological stress. This inclusive approach aims to ensure that all those in need of mental health support receive the necessary assistance.
In addition to meeting the immediate mental health needs of individuals, the Jerusalem Therapy Center will also offer long-term benefits through the provision of clinical fieldwork placements for Wurzweiler graduate students who speak English. These students will receive supervision from experienced clinicians, enabling them to develop important skills and contribute to the community in a meaningful way.
The Jerusalem Therapy Center is dedicated to providing valuable training and enrichment seminars for gap-year administrators, educators, directors, and therapists. These seminars equip professionals with the necessary tools to effectively support students who may be struggling. By offering a comprehensive approach, we ensure that those working with vulnerable populations receive the training needed to assist individuals facing mental health challenges.
Yeshiva University defied the national trend of declining college enrollment by achieving a record-breaking academic year. The university experienced a remarkable 20 percent increase in undergraduate enrollment from fall 2021 to fall 2022, showcasing a positive trajectory. The momentum is expected to continue in fall 2023, with applications rising by over 10 percent from the previous year. This growth in both quantity and quality stands in stark contrast to the nationwide trend of an 8 percent decline in college enrollment from 2019 to 2022, marking a significant achievement for Yeshiva University.
Yeshiva University's recent success in enrollment can be credited to its significant improvement in national rankings.

For example, the Bachelor's in Computer Science program at YU offers a forward-thinking curriculum designed to prepare students for successful transitions into high-level positions in the ever-evolving New Economy.
The university cultivates a vibrant and inclusive community, with over 150 student-led organizations and clubs that enhance the overall student experience. Through participation in a diverse range of extracurricular activities such as politics, Holocaust education, journalism, medical ethics, music, and the arts, students come together to form strong bonds and create a sense of unity within the campus community.
At the core of YU's exceptional undergraduate experience is the opportunity to learn from distinguished Torah faculty, such as world-renowned Roshei Yeshiva, Poskim, and Torah educators. This direct interaction with faculty not only enhances students' religious studies but also fosters personal growth and development in their Jewish lives. This is especially beneficial for students who have returned from intensive Torah study in Israel, as they are able to continue their learning and deepen their connection to their faith.
The Rise Up Campaign's ongoing success has enabled Yeshiva University to expand its scholarship programs, making education more affordable for a larger number of students. This initiative has not only provided financial aid but has also attracted a record number of new students to the university, highlighting the exceptional educational opportunities it offers.
Parents are increasingly valuing the impact of a Jewish education and environment on their children's formative years, especially in light of the rise in antisemitism both at home and abroad. Geri Mansdorf, Assistant Vice President of Enrollment, emphasizes the pivotal role that college years play in shaping individuals' identities, and highlights Yeshiva University as a secure space where students can develop their adult identities based on Jewish values.
In summary, Yeshiva University is a prestigious Jewish institution that excels in providing a top-tier college education alongside a strong yeshiva program. It fosters a supportive environment for those dedicated to Torah observance and fulfilling mitzvot. With the Rise Up Campaign driving YU towards greater achievements, its distinct academic and religious offerings remain highly sought after, serving as a pathway to significant professional and personal achievements for its students.

Federal aid refers to financial assistance provided by the government, such as the Federal Direct Unsubsidized Loan and the Federal Direct Graduate Plus Loan.
External funding refers to financial support received from sources that are outside of the university or government, such as scholarships, grants, or fellowships.
Private loans are financial assistance provided by non-government entities that individuals can seek out and apply for independently.
YU offers a variety of funding options, including merit-based scholarships, partial scholarships, and assistantships, to support both domestic and international students. The specific details of these funding opportunities vary by program, so we encourage you to reach out to the admissions office of your program of interest for more information.
Domestic students, including eligible US citizens and non-citizens, have access to federal aid. In order to receive this assistance, students must annually submit a Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) while enrolled in order to be considered for funding.
The Department of Education mandates that universities determine a cost of attendance for their programs. The total amount available for scholarships, grants, and other forms of financial aid, from both internal and external sources, must not exceed this established cost.
Tuition and university fees are considered direct expenses, while health insurance, supplies, transportation, and other living expenses are classified as indirect expenses. Any excess amount from a student loan, after deducting fees and covering the university bill, will be refunded to the student. This refund can then be used to cover indirect expenses.
The Yeshiva University Office of Student Finance oversees the administration of federal aid for students. They are well-versed in all aspects of federal financial aid and are especially knowledgeable about how it pertains to graduate students. For more information, you can contact them directly at 212.960.5399.
Graduate students have access to two primary types of federal loans. The maximum amount that can be borrowed per academic year (including summer, fall, and spring) is $20,500, with a loan origination fee deducted by the Department of Education before the university receives the funds. For further information on federal loans, please refer to additional resources.
Graduate Plus Loans offer flexibility in borrowing beyond tuition and fees to cover additional educational expenses such as books and lab fees. Borrowing is limited to the university's established cost of attendance, ensuring responsible borrowing. The loan features a fixed annual interest rate for financial stability.
If you are unable to qualify for a Plus Loan due to a negative credit history, you have the option to have a co-signer, known as an endorser, join the loan application or to appeal the decision with the Department of Education. The Department can provide guidance on how to strengthen your credit before a reassessment. Graduate Plus Loans are typically sought by students who require more than $20,500 per year in financial aid, using the loan to bridge the gap. Keep in mind that there is a loan origination fee deducted from the loan amount by the Department of Education before the university receives the funds. To learn more about Graduate Plus Loans, visit their website.
Unfortunately, Pell Grants and Direct Subsidized Stafford Loans are not available to graduate students. For more details on federal loans, such as interest rates and repayment schedules, please explore further information.
The YU Office of Student Finance has received notification that your loans have been approved. Your account will be promptly updated with the necessary loan information. Additionally, the Office will work on processing your financial aid, including tuition, scholarships, and federal loans, and will generate a bill that will be posted to your account.
Although there is no specific deadline, we recommend that you finish the FAFSA, Entrance Counseling, and your Master Promissory Notes (MPNs) by March 1 to allow yourself ample time to plan your finances before the start of fall semester classes. It is important to note that MPNs are valid for 10 years, Entrance Counseling is a one-time requirement, and the FAFSA needs to be completed annually.
Loan repayment and forgiveness programs offer individuals the opportunity to alleviate the burden of their student debt. By committing to eligible public service roles and making consistent loan payments for a decade, individuals may qualify for loan forgiveness.
It is important to clarify that loan forgiveness is only available for Federal Direct Unsubsidized Loans, and does not apply to GradPlus Loans or private loans. It is crucial to understand that the loan forgiveness process is not managed by Yeshiva University or any other university, and it is your responsibility to ensure that you meet the eligibility requirements, make timely payments, and apply for loan forgiveness after 10 years. It is worth noting that while Congress has enacted loan forgiveness, there is a possibility that it could be repealed in the future.
External funding refers to financial support from sources other than the university or government, such as scholarships, grants, or fellowships. These opportunities can be pursued independently by individuals. It is important to note that grants may be disbursed directly to you, and it is your responsibility to allocate these funds for tuition payment. Any external aid received must be reported to the Office of Student Finance.
F-1 visa holders have the opportunity to participate in Curricular Practical Training (CPT), which allows them to gain work experience directly related to their academic program.

History is more than just a subject to be studied or a puzzle to be solved. It is the shared story of humanity, shaping our world and our identities. By delving into the past, we gain insight into the events that have shaped our present society. Through the diverse perspectives and voices of history, we construct narratives that help us make sense of the world around us. While there may not be one definitive truth, history is not the same as myth - it is a powerful tool for understanding our collective journey.
As educators, we strive to impart essential skills to our students, including critical thinking, intellectual curiosity, the capability to develop well-supported arguments from credible sources, and the self-assurance to effectively present and defend their ideas in any setting.
The skills gained through studying history are valuable in various aspects of life, not just in academic settings. Students with a background in history are well-equipped for careers in law, public service, and any profession that demands critical thinking and a broad understanding of the world.

Having a minor is not necessary to secure a good job in the field of computer science across industries. Companies value hiring top software engineers and are willing to provide on-the-job training to equip them with the necessary knowledge about the business or industry.

In order to increase your chances of landing a good computer science job, it is beneficial to utilize your free time by creating software that is personally meaningful, useful, or important to you. This software should be unrelated to your coursework, and you should be able to articulate during an interview your motivation for building it and how you went about the development process.
Consider creating a public GitHub repository to showcase your coding skills and include a link to it on your resume. While taking relevant courses can be beneficial for personal and professional growth, having a minor listed on your resume is not essential for career success. Instead, focus on developing yourself into the person or professional you aspire to be by seeking out opportunities that will enhance your intellectual, emotional, and spiritual growth. This may involve taking courses, participating in extracurricular activities, or pursuing other avenues outside of the classroom.

This plan focuses on fostering personal growth and providing our students with exceptional support from our dedicated rabbis, faculty members, and fellow classmates at Yeshiva. Together, we will navigate the challenges and seize the opportunities presented by these unprecedented times.

In preparation for the upcoming fall semester, we have established a Scenario Planning Task Force comprised of representatives from various areas of our campus. This task force is utilizing the most up-to-date medical information, government guidelines, feedback from our religious leaders, faculty, and students, as well as insights from industry and educational leaders nationwide to develop our plans.
The planning process was informed by up-to-date medical information, government guidelines, input from rabbis, faculty, and students, as well as best practices from industry and university leaders nationwide. I am grateful to the task force members and their supporters for their dedicated efforts in addressing the numerous complexities of campus reopening and educational resumption.
I want to express my heartfelt gratitude to our dedicated task force members and all those who assisted them in their hard work to navigate the complexities of bringing students back to campus and resuming our educational mission.

Following the guidance of our task force, I am pleased to announce that our upcoming fall semester will be conducted using a hybrid model.

Prioritizing student safety, we offer the option for students to continue their studies online while still enjoying a full range of student services and extracurricular programs. This allows for a rich student experience even for those who prefer not to be on campus.
Ensuring the safety of our students is our top priority as we prepare to welcome them back to campus. As we plan for the upcoming semester, we recognize that many aspects of campus life will be different.
Significant changes are on the horizon for campus life in the upcoming semester. Gatherings will be restricted and larger courses will transition to online formats.

This approach allows us the flexibility to adjust our operations in response to the changing health situation, scaling back or moving forward as needed.
Reopening our campuses will be a nuanced process, more akin to adjusting a dimmer switch than simply flipping a light on or off. This approach allows us to adapt and respond effectively as the health situation continues to evolve. It is important to be prepared for potential changes in our plans, depending on the course of the virus and guidance from state and local authorities.
There is a potential for plans to change based on the evolving situation with the virus and government regulations. We will continue to provide updates closer to the start of the semester to ensure we are following the most up-to-date guidance.

In the coming months, we will be hosting community calls for faculty, students, staff, and parents. As we navigate through this challenging time, it is a humbling experience to plan for the future.

However, our tradition also emphasizes the importance of taking control of our reactions to the challenges and changes that come our way. As we look ahead to the next semester, we anticipate facing significant obstacles and adjustments.
The upcoming semester will bring about substantial changes and hurdles to overcome. While there may be some compromises and inconveniences along the way, not every challenge will have a flawless resolution.

Dear Yeshiva University Community,

I am excited to share with you our plans for the upcoming fall semester and the reopening of our campuses. This semester will be unique in both its format and its offerings.
This upcoming semester will be unlike any other in both its form and content. Our lives, work, and learning experiences will be transformed in unique ways.
We will embrace unique lifestyles, approaches to work, and methods of learning. It is within these differences that we find great strength and potential.
Yeshiva University's strength lies in its unique qualities, which grant it great influence. Our mission is to nurture the moral, intellectual, and spiritual growth of every student, equipping them with the skills and wisdom needed to make a meaningful impact and lead in the future.
Yeshiva University's mission is to nurture the holistic growth of every student, equipping them with the skills and knowledge needed to make a difference and lead in the future. The upcoming academic year will play a crucial role in shaping the trajectory of our students' lives.
The upcoming year's studies will play a crucial role in determining the trajectory of our students' lives. It is during moments of profound hardship that character is molded and strengthened.
Character is shaped and refined during challenging times. Yeshiva University is uniquely equipped to guide individuals through these moments of growth and learning.
This is the perfect opportunity for Yeshiva University to showcase its commitment to providing valuable learning experiences. We have created an educational plan for the upcoming year that focuses on delivering a top-notch student experience and emphasizes personal development in light of the challenges posed by the Coronavirus pandemic.
Therefore, we have crafted an educational strategy for the upcoming year that emphasizes providing students with a top-notch learning experience and focuses on fostering personal development in light of the challenges brought on by the Coronavirus pandemic. Our students will have the support of our exceptional rabbis and faculty, as well as their fellow students at Yeshiva, as they navigate through the obstacles and opportunities presented by the current COVID-19 era.
Our students will have the support of our exceptional rabbis, faculty, and peers at Yeshiva as they navigate the challenges and opportunities presented by the current COVID-19 era. 
To prepare for the upcoming fall semester, we have established a Scenario Planning Task Force with representatives from various departments across our campus.
In preparation for the upcoming fall semester, we have formed a Scenario Planning Task Force with representatives from various departments on campus. This group has utilized up-to-date medical data, government guidelines, feedback from our community members, and insights from industry and academic leaders nationwide to inform our strategic planning process.
The planning process has been informed by the most up-to-date medical knowledge, government guidelines, input from our rabbis, faculty, and students, as well as best practices from leaders in various industries and universities nationwide. I am grateful to the task force members and all who assisted them for their dedicated efforts in addressing the numerous intricacies involved in welcoming students back to campus and resuming our educational activities.
I want to express my sincere gratitude to the dedicated members of our task force and everyone who assisted them for their hard work in navigating the complexities of bringing students back to campus and resuming our educational activities. Building on the insights provided by our task force, I am pleased to announce that our upcoming fall semester will embrace a hybrid approach.
After careful consideration of our task force's recommendations, I am pleased to announce that our fall semester will follow a hybrid model. This approach combines online and virtual learning with on-campus classroom instruction, enabling a safe return for many students.
This approach offers a flexible learning environment that accommodates both on-campus and online instruction, allowing students to choose the mode of learning that best suits their preferences. Whether students prefer the traditional classroom setting or the convenience of online learning, they can access a variety of student services and extracurricular activities to enhance their overall college experience.
Our priority is ensuring the safety of our students as we welcome them back to campus. Additionally, we offer online study options and access to a variety of student services and extracurricular programs for those who choose to continue their studies remotely.
Ensuring the safety of our students is our top priority as we welcome them back to campus. There will be significant changes to various aspects of campus life for the upcoming semester.
There will be significant changes to campus life this semester, with restrictions on gatherings and a shift to online learning for larger courses.
In order to prioritize safety, gatherings will be restricted and larger classes will be conducted entirely online. Compliance with our medical protocols, such as social distancing, wearing masks, and following our testing and contact tracing procedures, will be required by all individuals on campus.
In order to prioritize the health and safety of our campus community, we ask that everyone follows our medical guidelines, which include practicing social distancing, wearing facemasks, and complying with our testing and contact tracing protocols.

To minimize potential risks, our undergraduate students will start the fall semester with online classes for the first few weeks. They will transition to on-campus learning after the conclusion of the Jewish holidays.
In order to prioritize safety, our undergraduate students will start the fall semester with online classes for the first few weeks and transition to on-campus learning after the Jewish holidays. This approach reduces the need for students to travel back and forth, as they will have a concentrated period of on-campus learning during one segment of the semester.
We have designed this schedule to minimize the need for students to travel back and forth frequently by consolidating the on-campus portion of the fall semester into one continuous block. As we have planned, we have likened our approach to adjusting a dimmer switch.
As we have carefully planned for the reopening of our campuses, we have likened the process to adjusting a dimmer switch. Rather than a simple on/off switch, our approach allows us to gradually adapt and respond to the changing health situation, with the flexibility to scale our operations as needed.
As we plan to reopen our campuses, we understand that it will not be a straightforward process. It will be more like adjusting a dimmer switch, allowing us the flexibility to adapt to changing health situations. We may need to modify our plans based on the progression of the virus and guidance from state and local authorities.
There is a possibility that our plans may change based on the development of the virus and guidance from state and local authorities. We will continue to provide updates before the semester starts to ensure we are following the most up-to-date guidance.
Prior to the start of the semester, we will continue to update our guidance to reflect the most current information. For regular updates, please visit our website at yu.edu/fall2020.

In April 2021, Yeshiva University acknowledged the importance of student organizations and clubs in enhancing student life and fostering opportunities for learning and leadership development. The university values these groups as integral parts of the community and allows officially recognized student organizations and clubs to use the YESHIVA UNIVERSITY and/or shield design marks (the YU Marks) to showcase their affiliation with the university.

However, the university reserves the right to revoke this privilege at any time and for any reason at its discretion. To continue using the YU Marks, student organizations and clubs must maintain good standing and remain recognized by the university.
Student organizations and clubs are encouraged to create their own unique logos that do not contain any YU Marks or elements, or anything that could be confused with the YU Marks. It is important that any design created is completely original and does not resemble any trademarked University logos in any way.
Student organizations and clubs are encouraged to create their own logo that is original and does not resemble any of the University logos or brand elements. It is important that the design does not contain any elements that could negatively reflect on the University, its members, or the community.
To ensure clarity and distinction, student organizations and clubs are mandated to include identifiers like "club," "society," "association," or "chapter" in their name and logo. This helps clearly establish them as student-led groups, separate from University departments or other units. Additionally, if the terms "Yeshiva" or "Yeshiva University" are included, it must be evident that the organization or club is affiliated with students.
The purpose of these guidelines is to safeguard and regulate the use of the University's logos and marks. The University takes pride in recognizing its student organizations and clubs as important members of our community. It is essential for both the University community and the public to distinguish what is affiliated with the University, what products/services are produced by the University, and what is not.

Request an interview with a YU Admissions Officer by scheduling it HERE.
Yeshiva University embraces a comprehensive approach when evaluating an applicant's qualifications. The interview process provides the Admissions officer with the opportunity to personally connect with each applicant and gain a deeper understanding of who they are beyond their application materials.
Congratulations on your acceptance to Yeshiva University! As a newly admitted student, you have the opportunity to have the college courses you took during high school count towards your undergraduate degree.
In order to qualify for immigration sponsorship from Yeshiva University, you must be accepted into a full-time, classroom-based academic program at the university. Please note that students enrolled in online programs are not eligible for immigration sponsorship.
If you have not been accepted yet, please go to the admission page for your desired degree level and college. If you plan to attend as a full-time student, you must enter the U.S. in an immigration status that allows for full-time study.
Most full-time international students at YU and in the U.S. typically hold F-1 student status and possess the I-20 Certificate of Eligibility for Non-Immigrant Student Status. Additionally, there are non-degree exchange students at YU who come for a brief period under the J-1 Exchange Visitor program, holding the DS-2019 Certificate of Eligibility for J-1 Exchange Visitor Status.
Below, you will find important information regarding document and visa application requirements, as well as helpful tips for preparation and arrival. The majority of international students at YU are typically in F-1 student status and are required to apply for an I-20 visa.
If you are considering bringing your spouse and/or children with you, they will need to apply for an F-2 dependent visa. It is important to note that F-2 dependents are not permitted to work in the U.S. and are restricted to part-time study.
Many students, particularly those from Cardozo Law participating in an official academic exchange program, come to the US on a J-1 exchange visitor status and apply for a DS-2019 form. In order to qualify as a J-1 student, a significant portion of your funding must come from sources other than personal or family funds, or you must be enrolled in an official academic exchange program.
If you intend to bring your spouse and/or children along, they will be required to apply for a J-2 dependent visa. J-2 dependents have the opportunity to seek employment and pursue studies.
To receive detailed guidance on obtaining your I-20, please view our instructional video. Admitted students with F and J visas can apply for their immigration document through the YU International Student Portal.
Upon being fully admitted, students will be sent an email containing a user ID and temporary password. In order to proceed with the enrollment process, a seat deposit is typically necessary.
Please ensure to regularly monitor your YU email for the auto-email that will be sent to your YU email address. This email will be from DoNotReply@oiss.yu.edu and will have the subject line: YU International Portal Website: Login Information. Do not try to access the YU International Student Portal until you have received this email invitation.
Your account will be set up within 2-3 business days. If you try to access the YU International Student Portal before your account is activated, you will receive an error message.
As you await the invitation email, you can begin preparing the required documents. Graduate students who have been accepted to the Katz School of Science and Health can reach out to Hyokyeong Yu (Kyeong) for any questions regarding their I-20 application.
Before starting the I-20 or DS-2019 application, please carefully read through all instructions. You will need the following documents to complete the application:

- A copy of your YU admission letter (an electronic copy is acceptable)
- A copy of the photo page of your passport, as well as for any dependents who will be joining you in the US.
A legal partner and children under the age of 21 are eligible to accompany you to the US in F-2 dependent status. Additionally, you must provide financial documents demonstrating that you have sufficient funds to cover one year of expenses related to your academic program.
In order to attend YU, it is essential that you have the means to cover your tuition, fees, health insurance, and living expenses annually. Please refrain from relying on working in the U.S. to make up for any financial shortfalls.
You can find information about estimated annual expenses on the YU International Student Portal Homepage. Simply click on the link located on the left side of the page.
It is important to be prepared for a yearly tuition and fees increase of 3%. Students have the option to seek various forms of financial assistance, such as YU scholarships, parental contributions, and personal loans.
All documentation submitted must be in English. For detailed financial documentation information, please refer to the learning content section of your Request for I-20 Application on the YU International Student Portal.
We are unable to accept certain types of documentation, including property deeds, mortgage statements, retirement account statements, business account statements, life insurance policies, credit card statements displaying available credit, and certain Certificates of Deposit with a maturity date extending past your expected graduation date. Additionally, we are unable to consider financial support from other students in F-1 status, regardless of their employment status.
Transfer students in F-1 status studying in the US are required to complete the SEVIS School Transfer-In procedure and request a new I-20. This process is conveniently automated through the I-20 application on the YU International Student Portal.
You can find more details about this topic in the learning content on the online application. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact the office via email at oiss@yu.edu.
After receiving your complete application, we will begin processing your I-20 or DS-2019. Rest assured, we will reach out to you if any additional information or documentation is required.
Please remember to regularly check your YU email while awaiting your document. We are cognizant of the visa processing timelines and are committed to expediting the issuance of I-20 or DS-2019 forms to each student.
We kindly request that you wait a minimum of 5 business days after submitting your application before inquiring about its status. Our priority is to dedicate our time and effort towards processing your documents efficiently. Thank you for your patience and understanding.
If we require any further documentation, we will reach out to you via your YU email address. In the meantime, we recommend exploring Study in the States, the official website of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, while you await your immigration document.
After your immigration document is issued, it will typically be sent directly to you. If you receive an I-20, a digitally signed PDF will be sent to your YU email address.
Once you receive the DS-2019 form, you can print it out and use it for your F-1 visa application and entry into the United States. The OISS will send you the original document via FedEx after it is issued.
If it is more convenient for you, you can choose to pick up your documents in person. If you prefer to have your documents mailed overseas using a different service than FedEx, please contact the OISS.
In addition to your I-20 or DS-2019, you will receive further instructions on the next steps to take. Please review all the information provided carefully, as we will also be sending you important updates that you must be aware of!
After obtaining your I-20 or DS-2019, the next important step is to make a required payment for the U.S. government SEVIS Fee. This fee can be conveniently paid online through Form I-901.
Certain countries may have restrictions on online payment methods. In such cases, alternative payment options are available on the SEVIS fee website.
Dependents of F-2 and J-2 visa holders are exempt from the fee. 
For online payments, be sure to print out the receipt as soon as you complete the transaction.
You are not required to ask for a paper receipt. 
Find out more information about the SEVIS fee.
In order to apply for a student visa or cross the U.S. border as a Canadian, you will need to have a SEVIS fee receipt. Detailed instructions on how to pay the I-901 Fee can be found in our F-1 Pre-Departure Orientation video.

Please respond courteously and directly to the questions posed by the Consular Officer. English proficiency is required for the interview.
Improve your English skills by engaging in conversations with others, watching English television, and listening to English radio broadcasts.

Before making any decisions, it is important to reflect on the significant economic and familial connections you have to your home country that may influence your desire to return. In the event that your visa application is rejected, it is advisable to request a written explanation for the denial and reach out to the Office of International Students and Scholars (OISS) for guidance and support.
In many instances, reapplying with supplementary documentation can increase the likelihood of approval. F and J students are only permitted to enter the U.S. up to 30 days before the start date indicated on their I-20 or DS-2019 forms.
The sole exception applies to students transferring to YU from another school within the US. Transfer students moving between schools outside of the US may return at any time with YU's I-20.

Take the time to research the average test scores of accepted students in order to assess your own standing and decide if test prep courses may be beneficial for you. This proactive approach will help you make informed decisions about your future academic pursuits.
When looking into schools, it's important to take into account various factors like cost, size, location, entrance requirements, and program quality. Investing in test prep courses from reputable organizations like The Princeton Review and Kaplan, while expensive, can be a valuable decision, particularly for individuals who find standardized tests challenging.
Consult with professors and carefully review materials from prospective schools to confirm that you fulfill the entrance criteria. Pay close attention to the test filing deadlines, especially if you observe the Sabbath, and make sure to submit your applications on time.
Before enrolling in the program, it is important to explore the research areas of the faculty to ensure that they align with your interests.

To find out more information about test dates or local test centers, you can consult the Student Guidance Center (SGC) or contact the Educational Testing Service (ETS) directly.
To make a more informed decision, take into account factors such as the existence of a vibrant Jewish community and how well the program aligns with your personal interests.

It is important to start preparing early: Complete applications and craft your personal statement ahead of time to avoid feeling rushed and stressed at the last minute.
When choosing schools to apply to, consider a diverse range of options including safety schools and reach schools that align with your academic interests. For example, psychology and pre-med students may apply to around fifteen schools, while social work students typically apply to five schools.
Many assessments evaluate your proficiency in language, English, and reading comprehension, as well as your quantitative and logical reasoning abilities, and writing skills. Some tests may also delve into specialized technical knowledge related to your field of study, resembling achievement exams.
Common admissions tests such as the GRE, MAT, GMAT, LSAT, and various medical exams like the MCAT, DAT, and OAT are often required for entry into graduate programs or professional schools. It is important to research the average test scores of admitted students at the schools you are interested in to gauge your own standing and decide if additional preparation is necessary. This information can help you make informed decisions about taking practice tests and potentially enrolling in a test preparation course.
Investing in test prep courses from reputable companies like The Princeton Review and Kaplan can be expensive, but it could be a valuable decision, especially if you struggle with standardized tests. Make sure to take note of the filing dates, especially if you observe the Sabbath.

Invest time and effort into your essays because schools do take the time to read them. Your essay is a chance to demonstrate to the Admissions Committee that you are a well-rounded individual beyond just your academic achievements.
When applying for a graduate degree, it is important to clearly communicate your aspirations and motivations to the school. This not only helps schools understand your goals, but also allows them to evaluate your writing skills. One key tip is to customize your essay for each school's specific application requirements.
In academic programs, it is important to focus on discussing research or academic issues within the field. On the other hand, in practical and applied programs, a more personal approach is often encouraged.
Take the time to reflect on your unique qualities in order to make your essay memorable. Avoid using exaggerated language and simply listing accomplishments.
Share your achievements and the obstacles you have conquered. Provide specific examples and infuse your personal journey into your narrative.
Reflect on your personal growth and the valuable lessons you have gained from your experiences. Consider how these experiences have shaped your understanding of yourself, others, or your chosen field.

Yeshiva College's Department of Computer Science has established an Academic Integrity Policy that outlines guidelines for resources and collaboration on assignments. The policy specifies which sources of information can be used, the level of collaboration allowed among students, and whether incorporating someone else's work is permitted.

These rules are communicated to students through assignment instructions, lecture slides, course syllabi, class emails, and online forums. It is the students' responsibility to understand and adhere to both the general rules of each course and the specific guidelines for each assignment.

In cases where there is uncertainty about a particular resource, students should err on the side of caution and assume that its use is not allowed until clarification is provided by the professor.
When incorporating code or other work from external sources into an assignment, students must adhere to the citation guidelines provided by their professor. If no specific citation practice is specified, students should include the URL of the code and the date it was retrieved.
The code snippet below demonstrates how to sort a list of numbers in Python using the built-in sort() function. 

```python
numbers = [4, 2, 7, 1, 3]
numbers.sort()
print(numbers)
```

This code creates a list of numbers, `[4, 2, 7, 1, 3]`, and then uses the `sort()` method to arrange the numbers in ascending order. The sorted list is then printed out, resulting in `[1, 2, 3, 4, 7]`. 

Adapted from: https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#list.sort

Studying history at YU is a unique experience that goes beyond simply acquiring skills or solving problems. It offers a deeper understanding of the past and how it shapes the present, providing valuable insights into the complexities of human societies and cultures.
History is the shared narrative of humanity, a reflection of our past and a roadmap to understanding the present world and our own identities. Through studying history, we gain insights into the evolution of our society and ourselves.
We have come to understand that events can be interpreted in numerous ways, with multiple perspectives and voices shaping the same story. Historians skillfully uncover and bring to life these diverse voices, utilizing them to craft narratives that provide insight into our past and help us make sense of our present society.
While we acknowledge the existence of multiple perspectives and the absence of a definitive truth, we understand that history and myth should not be conflated. As educators, we strive to impart essential skills to our students, such as critical thinking, a thirst for knowledge, the capacity to develop well-supported arguments based on credible sources, and the confidence to effectively present and defend their ideas in any setting.
Having skills in history can be beneficial in various aspects of life, not just limited to academia. Students who are proficient in history are well-suited for careers in law, public service, and any profession that demands critical thinking and a comprehensive knowledge of the world.
Individuals who choose to pursue teaching careers in secondary or postgraduate education at Yeshiva University will graduate with a comprehensive understanding of core historical subjects and the necessary academic skills to succeed in advanced studies. The department is dedicated to fostering the intellectual growth of all students, regardless of their chosen major or future career path.
